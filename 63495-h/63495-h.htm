<p>America has just passed through a great financial crisis—one
of the many which occur from time to time, because of badly
adjusted financial conditions, and as the result of greed—and
we hear much talk of “hard times,” and the lack of money
wherewith to buy the necessities of life. Now, I believe that
such “hard times,” and such conditions, could be largely
averted if only the people were taught to live correctly:
taught how to economise their food, and how to take care of
their bodies. There can be no doubt but that much of the
waste which occurs throughout the land is due to ignorance of
the great laws of life and health; and if people were only
taught how to reduce their food-supply scientifically—and
not to expend so much money on their bodies, and especially on
their food—there would be but a small amount of suffering
compared with that which has existed in the past. Teach the
public how to preserve the body in a state of health, upon a
small amount of money, and we shall have solved one of the
greatest economic factors confronting us to-day. I believe
that this may be brought about, in a large part at least, by
adopting the principles of nutrition outlined in this book; and
I submit it to the public largely with that idea in mind.
But that is only part of my object, none the less. My desire
is to help humanity to secure better health—to teach them
how to live cheaply and economically; above all, how to live
so as to preserve the highest standard of health, strength and
energy. We should thus have a cleaner, a hardier and a
happier race of individuals; and I firmly believe that all true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>6</span>
reform—social economic religious—must come primarily
through the body—<i>i.e.</i> these reforms can only be effected by
first of all reforming the body, and its habits; and when that
has been rendered clean and pure, the coveted mental and
moral reforms will be found to follow of themselves. External
conditions and environment may count for much, but the internal
factor counts for much more. The internal personality
of the man is what we should aim to reach first of all;
and this can be reached most easily and effectually by means
if the body—for in that he is most wrapped; with its feelings
and emotions he is most closely connected. Reform the
inner man, and particularly his body, and trust to man to
reform his environment. Make men and women what they
ought to be, and they will soon reform their external conditions.</p>

<p>I have attempted to deal, in this volume, with the <i>quality</i>
of foods, as I dealt with their <i>quantity</i>, in my former book. In
this way, the ground will have been pretty thoroughly covered,
from the particular point of view from which I have attacked
these problems. I can only hope that, as the result of these
two volumes, many persons may find health and a long life,
who would otherwise have sunk into a premature grave. If
I could feel that I had in any way helped to accomplish this,
I should be more than satisfied.</p>

<small>THE NATURAL FOOD OF MAN</small></h2></div>


<p>There can be no doubt that, whatever other function
food may or may not have, it replaces broken-down
tissue. The tissue-wastes of the preceding day are
replenished by the food eaten; so the body remains
about the same in weight, no matter how much exercise
be taken, or how much tissue is broken down. These
tissues are very complex in their nature, and a variety
of food is consequently necessary to restore the tissues
destroyed—food containing a number of elements
(the counterpart of the elements destroyed), being
necessary to offset the waste. Proteid, fats, carbohydrates,
and various salts are, therefore, necessary in
the food; and no food that does not contain these constituents,
in larger or smaller quantities, can be used by
the body, or can be classed as a true “food.” Other
things being equal, therefore, it may be said that <i>a food
is nutritious and capable of sustaining life in proportion
to its complexity—the best food being one that most nearly
supplies the wastes of the tissues</i>. If an article of diet
contains only one of the essential elements necessary
for supporting life, the body, if fed upon it, will waste
away and die—no matter <i>how much</i> of that food be
eaten. In certain experiments conducted upon dogs,
it was found that, when they were fed upon fat—<i>e.g.</i>
they became round, plump, <i>embonpoint</i>, and yet died of
inanition! The same would be true of any other single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>10</span>
article of diet. If an animal were fed upon it, he would
surely die, sooner or later. Proteids are supposed to
supply most of the muscle-forming elements, and a part
of the energy expended by the body; fats and carbohydrates
are supposed to be of use chiefly in supplying
heat and energy to the system. The mineral salts that
are contained in the foods do not fulfil any definite
function, so far as is known; but they are very essential,
nevertheless. If a diet lacks these salts entirely, the
body wastes away and dies of “saline starvation.” It
will thus be apparent that foods very rapidly and very
forcibly affect the state of the health, and even the life
of the individual. Food, it must be remembered, <i>makes
blood</i>; and the blood is absolutely dependent upon the
food supply for its character and composition. If the
food be poisonous in character, the blood soon becomes
tainted, and the mind, no less than the body, shows the
effects of this poisoning process. On any theory we
may hold of the nature of mind, and its connection with
the body, it is certainly <i>dependent</i> upon the body for its
manifestation, in this life; and is coloured and influenced
by the state of the body, and by the condition of the
blood. This I have shown more fully in another place.
We shall also see the effects of diet upon the mind, more
clearly, as we proceed in the present volume.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will at all events be
apparent that this question of the food supply is a very
important one—indeed one of the most important before
the world to-day. The first thought, the first instinct,
of any animal, is to search for and secure food; self-preservation
is the most powerful instinct in the world,
and the nutrition of the body occupies first place, as
one means of preserving life. In the lower organisms,
we see this very clearly; they spend almost the whole
of their lives in searching for and devouring food; but
as we ascend the scale of evolution, we find less and less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>11</span>
space devoted, in the body, to the digestive organs, and
more and more to the brain, and instruments of the
mind. It would appear, therefore, that the higher we
ascend in the scale of evolution, the less proportionate
space in the body is devoted to the purely animal
processes, and the more to the mental and spiritual sides
of man. <i>As the mentality increases, the need for food
decreases</i>: this is a very significant law—for such I
believe it to be. It would seem to indicate that man
attained the highest level, so far as his physical or
physiological structure was concerned; and that evolution
thenceforward tended to develop that side of man
which rendered possible the increased mental and
spiritual characteristics. However, I shall not dwell
too strongly upon that point now.</p>

<p>Although an adequate supply of food is very necessary
to all organisms, there is but little danger that anyone
in a civilised community would run the risk of starving
to death, because of the lack of food. The tendency is
all the other way, and most persons eat, not too little,
but far too much, food. Even the very poor, and
especially the babies of the very poor—eat too often,
and too much. This may seem strange, but it becomes
more rational and intelligible when we take into account
the fact that the human body needs <i>so little food</i>, in
reality, to supply the wastes of the day, that the very
poor, even if they have far less food than the majority,
still have too much. The average person eats at least
three times more food than his system really requires;
and it is due to this very fact, I earnestly believe, that
much of the suffering and of the insanity, and many of
the diseases, are so constantly with us. In his recently
published works, Professor Chittenden has shown with
great detail that the average standard “dietary tables”
of the physiologists have been far too high; and that
the average man can cut down his proteid intake fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>12</span>
one third, without detriment, but, on the contrary, with
added benefit to himself. The majority of persons eat
far more than the physiologists have said to be necessary;
and now it has been shown that the physiologists
have set the standard three times too high! It would
appear, therefore, that most persons eat more than three
times too much proteid; and the same has been found
to hold good of the fats and carbohydrates, in a lesser
degree, also. But while the fats and carbohydrates
can be eliminated by the system, or stored up within
it, without positive danger, proteid in excess creates
an abundance of uric acid, and causes much harm to
the system throughout. It is the excess of proteid that
is the chief cause of many of the diseases from which
mankind suffers; and, if health is to be maintained, we
must see to it that this great excess is not ingested into
the body. While keeping up the due allowance, we
must be careful not to eat those foods which tend to
introduce this excess into the system; and, by avoiding
them, it will be seen that we thereby avoid all danger of
creating an undue amount of uric acid, and consequently
of suffering from the induced diseases.</p>

<p>Now, it is a well-known fact that meat contains a
large proportion of protein; and further, that it has a
great tendency to create uric acid in the system, owing
to the decaying cell-nuclei that form a large part of its
structure. Meat is by no means a clean article of diet,
but on the contrary a very unclean one; and many
foods, supplying an equal amount of proteid matter, are
to be preferred, for the reason that they supply less
toxic material—which invariably accompanies flesh-meat.
It must be remembered that the tissues of all
animals contain a certain amount of poisonous material—simply
by reason of the fact that the animal has lived
at all—since all animals are constantly creating poisons
within their bodies, by the very process of living. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>13</span>
poisons are being thrown off by the body every minute
throughout the day; and it is because of that fact the
animal is enabled to remain alive at all. Were this
process of elimination checked for a few hours, death by
poisoning would inevitably result—in consequence of the
poisons formed by the body itself. All animals, then,
create these poisons; and it would be impossible to find
an animal body without them. So that, when we eat the
flesh of any animal, we must eat, together with the
nutritious portions, these poisons—which are practically
inseparable from all animal tissue. That is, whenever
we eat meat, we invariably eat, at the same time, a
certain quantity of poison—which it is impossible to
avoid! I shall elaborate this idea at considerable length
in my chapter on the hygiene of diet. In this place I
shall only call attention to that fact—the strongest
argument of all, to my mind, for abstaining from flesh;
and shall point out that, if any diet furnishes all the
nutritious properties of meat, without these poisons, it
is certainly to be preferred, on that account. We shall
see, when we come to the chapter devoted to the
chemistry of foods, that all the elements contained in
meat are also contained in a purer and better form in
other substances—grains, some vegetables, and in nuts—and
in as large or larger proportions than they are in
meat.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that certain foods are better for
us than others—a fact which daily observation confirms.
Everyone knows that certain articles of diet are
indigestible, others not so much so: that some are
nutritious, and others hardly of any food value at all.
Some foods are better for us than others, therefore;
and, if we wish to maintain our health, it is obvious that
we should eat those foods, and only those foods, as a
general thing, which can be shown to be of use and
benefit to the body. If some foods are thus more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>14</span>
wholesome than others, does it not behove everyone
interested in the health and care of his body—and
especially all those interested in hygiene, or the improvement
of the race—to endeavour to ascertain what
these foods are, those most natural and best for the
human body; and, having found them, to advise all
who wish to maintain their bodies in the highest state
of health, to live upon these foods—or at least to make
them the staple articles of their diet? Believing this
to be most certainly true, I shall devote myself, in the
present volume, to a careful search through the records
and evidences of science, and endeavour to ascertain
in what man’s natural food consists; and, having found
the food which is indicated by nature as the best and
most natural for man, I shall proceed to give my reasons
for thinking that this food is the most wholesome, and
why it is that all other foods must be more or less harmful
to the system. This done, we shall be in a position
to define what foods are “natural” for man, and indicate
why it is that they are the most wholesome.</p>

<p>In order to clarify the problem, then, and clear away
any misconceptions that may arise in the reader’s mind,
I shall state here what my conclusions are, and my
reasons for thinking them sound. Assuming that there
is an “ideal” diet of some sort—that upon which the
human race originally lived, and which it should still
live upon, if it wishes to maintain the best possible
health—I have gone carefully through the various food-stuffs,
and, by careful analysis, have shown that all
meats are injurious to the body, for the reason that
they are not suited to it, by reason of its anatomical
structure—and, further, by the facts of experience and
hygiene, which clearly indicate that if man eats meat,
he suffers in consequence. These arguments will be
found in full in the book. I also found that there were
many objections to all vegetables, to cereals, grains and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>15</span>
flour of all kinds; to soups, to bread and eggs, to butter,
milk, cheese, and to all dairy products. Most cookbooks
and works devoted to the hygiene of foods have
been in the habit of pointing out all the beneficial and
<i>good</i> qualities of these foods, and saying very little
about their <i>bad</i> qualities. In this book, I have pointed
out all the bad qualities, and have insisted that these so
far offset their good qualities as to show them utterly
unfitted for human food, and consequently to be discarded
from any truly hygienic diet. Thus, by a process
of elimination, we are forced to the conclusion that
the only foods that are really natural to man, those best
suited to his organism, are fruits and nuts—the diet of
his anthropoid brethren, and man’s own natural diet,
as is clearly indicated by his anatomical structure.
Fruits and nuts will alone suffice to maintain the human
body in the highest state of health; and are the foods
which should be adopted, and eaten, by mankind, to
the exclusion of all others. From them, he can obtain
all the elements necessary for the upbuilding of a healthy
body; and from them he can derive the greatest
amount of health and strength, and the greatest amount
of energy.</p>

<p>Many persons would be willing to concede, I fancy,
that man can live without meat—indeed, there is no
escaping this conclusion, since thousands of persons are
actually doing so. But not very many would be willing
to concede, probably, that all breads, grains, and
vegetables are to be abandoned as unfit for human food
also! They would be unwilling to admit that! And
yet I think it can be shown very conclusively that none
of these foods are intended for the human being, any
more than is the grass of the field. Each <i>genus</i> has its
own particular food, allotted by nature; and man’s
food consists—or should consist—of fruit and nuts.
Further, these fruits and nuts should be eaten
uncooked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>16</span>—in
their original, primitive form. I am convinced that
cooking ruins nearly all foods treated in that manner—my
arguments for this will be found in full in the chapter
on “The Fruitarian Diet.”</p>

<p>If this be true, as I most firmly believe it is—it will be
seen that practically all other foods are naturally barred
out, by the very nature of the case. Certainly no one
would care to eat his meat raw; and all vegetables, with
very few exceptions, would also fall under the ban, for
but few of them can well be eaten without cooking.
Grains, also, are very unappetising, when eaten raw,
and it is now well known that but a small amount of
their starch is converted properly, in the body, unless
the grains are well cooked; so that all these foods would
be eliminated from the diet, and practically nothing
left but fruits and nuts! Although this may seem
appalling to the average reader, it is the logical outcome
of the theory, and I am convinced the right interpretation
of the facts. The fruitarian diet is the one best
suited for man; and the one upon which he can live best
and longest. I myself have lived upon this fruit and
nut diet almost exclusively for several years, and I
may perhaps say that I am always in excellent spirits
and condition, and a source of constant surprise to my
friends in that I seem to possess an untiring energy and
ability for work. I say this, not to boast, but to show
that a diet of this character is perfectly compatible
with health and strength; and I believe that almost
any person could double his energies, his health, and
his self-respect by adopting a diet of this character.
For it has a tremendous effect upon the mental and
moral, no less than upon the physical life, as I shall
presently endeavour to show.</p>

<p>With the invention of fire, however, many articles
of food became edible which had not been edible before.
Finding that grains and roots, and certain weeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span>
(vegetables) could be eaten, when cooked, although they
were uneatable when raw, man took to cooking his food,
and substituting this food for a portion of his original
diet—which was probably scarce at the time. In
this way, the cooking of food probably originated. It
began in the far-off ages, and has been handed
down to us—a legacy of barbarism, to which man
rigidly clings, in the vain effort to preserve a distinction
between himself and other animals—who do not cook
their food—because of this fact! He prides himself
that he is the only “cooking animal”! If man would
only learn that it is owing to this very process of
cooking that much of the suffering, and many of the
ills from which mankind suffers, are due!</p>

<p>Many persons imagine that, if they returned to a
primitive diet of this character, they would become
as the savages—wild and uncivilised. They “don’t
want to become like the animals,” they will say. They
wish to remain “civilised,” and not return to a state
of savagery and barbarism! There is no logic in this
argument—indeed, no sense. Because a man lives
upon fruits and nuts, it is, of course, no reason why he
should return to a primitive state, <i>mentally</i>; indeed,
there is far less evidence for this than there is that
man becomes like the carnivorous animals by eating
meat. There is evidence for that! But living upon
fruits and nuts has no other effect than to elevate the
tone and character of the body; to increase its energies
and to render the mind clearer and more active. If
these objectors to the fruitarian diet would only study
physiology and human nature before passing any such
absurd judgment upon the facts, their arguments would
have more force—but then, in that case, they would
not raise the arguments at all! Of course, this whole
idea is conclusively proved to be erroneous by the facts
in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span></p>

<p>There is one other point I should like to touch upon,
though briefly, before passing on to the main argument
of the book. The usual position with regard to food,
and its functions in the body is this. Food has three
functions: (1) The replacement of tissues which have
been broken down as the result of the day’s work; (2) the
maintenance of the bodily energy; and (3) the maintenance
of the bodily heat. Now, in my former book,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I
advanced a number of facts tending to show that food
has but <i>one</i> function—replacing broken-down tissue.
It supplies no heat and no energy whatever to the
body, at any time, or under any circumstances. Both
the heat and the energy are due to another source
altogether, and not to the food ingested.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I cannot
enumerate the arguments in support of this position
here; they will be found in full in the work referred to;
but I would point out that, if this theory were true, it
would cause us to modify very largely the views entertained
as to the necessary amount of food required
by the body. Now, a large percentage of the food eaten
is supposed to create heat and energy, or at least
liberate it, and is eaten for that express purpose. But
if it be true that food has no other function than to
supply the body with material for the rebuilding of
its structures and tissues, it will be apparent that
far <i>less</i> food is necessary than is usually thought to be
necessary by the physiologists; and this would account
for the enormous differences in quantity said to be</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span></p>

<p>necessary by the various physiologists. The truth of
the matter doubtless is, that the <i>smallest</i> amount of
food is that which is necessary, and all amounts over
and above this are passed through the body at an expense
of the vital energies, and to the detriment of the
vital economy. However, I shall not dwell unduly
upon this point, in this place; partly because Dr
Rabagliati and myself are, as yet, practically alone in
our belief that the energy of the body does not come
from the food; and partly because this book is devoted
to the <i>quality</i> of the various foods, rather than to their
<i>quantity</i>—as was my former book. Both—quantity
and quality—are of great interest and importance;
but as I have already said all that is necessary regarding
one aspect of this question—that of quantity—I
feel that a somewhat detailed discussion of the
“quality” of food could not fail to be of interest. I
accordingly turn to this aspect of the problem; and
shall devote the remaining pages of this book to a
discussion of the relative qualities and proportions of
the various foods.</p>

<small>THE ARGUMENT FROM COMPARATIVE ANATOMY</small></h2></div>


<p>Perhaps the most important factor of all, in considering
this question of man’s natural diet, is the anatomical
argument—the argument, that is, which says that
man must or should naturally eat certain foods, for
the reason that he belongs to the class or <i>genus</i> of
animals which lives upon that class of foods—and that,
consequently, he should live upon them also. Comparative
anatomy affords us one of the most tangible
and at the same time one of the most forceful and
convincing arguments that can be furnished in favour
of man’s natural diet (whatever that may prove to
be)—for the reason that its <i>facts</i> are so well-attested
that they cannot be gainsaid by anyone who is in
possession of them; and only the <i>inferences drawn
from these facts</i> can be disputed—which is a question
that will be considered later. As before stated, this
line of argument is in many ways the most important
with which we shall have to deal; it will tend either
to condemn or to confirm my argument most strongly.
From a scientific standpoint, the study of this subject
is founded upon the fact that the diet of any animal,
in its natural state, is always found to agree both
with its anatomical structure and with its several
digestive processes and general bodily functions. So
clearly is this fact recognised, indeed, by comparative
anatomists and scientists generally, that animals have
been divided, according to their dietetic habits, into
four great classes—herbivorous, frugivorous, carnivorous
and omnivorous. There are various sub-and
minor-divisions that can be and in fact are made—such
as the gramnivora, or grain-eaters; the rodentia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span>
or gnawers; the ruminants, or cud-chewers; and the
edentata or creatures without teeth. These subdivisions
need not concern us here, however; and I
shall not discuss their anatomical structure or food-habits
at any length. Their names sufficiently classify
them—in a work of this nature, which deals with
<i>foods</i>, and is not a natural history. For practical
purposes, the gramnivora may be included in the class
of frugivora—since most frugivorous animals eat
grains to some extent. This understood, we can proceed
to a consideration of the facts; and we shall see
to which of these classes man belongs.</p>

<p>In order to classify an animal, and place him in his
proper division, it is necessary first of all to make a
careful examination of his physical structure, and
examine his organs in turn and severally, with the utmost
care; when, by a comparative study of his organs,
and by comparing them with those of other animals,
living upon other foods, we shall be enabled to classify
man properly—at least, so far as the evidence afforded
by comparative anatomy enables us to reach a decisive
conclusion one way or the other. There are numerous
other facts and arguments to be taken into consideration;
but, as said before, the argument drawn from
comparative anatomy is the most complete and convincing
of all—since that alone practically settles the
case for all other animals. Let us, therefore, consider
the structure or anatomy of man, from this point of
view; and see how far these arguments lead us, and
to what class we should naturally assign man, from a
study of these facts alone. I shall take up for discussion
first of all the teeth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Teeth</span></p>

<p><i>The Herbivora.</i>—Let us consider first the teeth of the
herbivorous animal. The horse, the ox, and the sheep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span>
are typical of this class of animals—living, as they do,
almost entirely upon grass and herbs. The character
of their food is peculiar. It is bulky, coarse, and
covered with sharp, cutting edges—ill suited for tender
mouths and gums. It must be mashed and ground
thoroughly between the teeth and in the mouth before
it is fit to be swallowed; and teeth of a peculiar construction
and mutual relation are necessary in order
properly to perform this function. Just such teeth they
possess. There are twenty-four molars, six on each
side in each jaw; and in the lower jaw, in front, eight
incisors, or cutting teeth, with none on the upper jaw.
In place of any of these teeth on the upper jaw, there is
simply a horny plate upon which the long incisors of the
lower jaw impinge when the jaws are closed. This
renders possible the tearing, grinding motions necessary
for biting off and masticating the food upon
which these animals live. Not only that. The actual
<i>structure</i> of their teeth is peculiarly suited to their
food and its mastication. Unlike our teeth, they are
not covered with enamel, but are composed of
alternate layers of enamel and dentine—a soft, bony
substance lying between the layers of enamel, and
wearing away more rapidly than it does. The result
is that there is soon formed a series of jagged edges,
which form cutting, grinding surfaces, and are especially
adapted for the food which these animals feed upon.
No such formation is present in any other class of
animals, since their food is different from that of the
herbivora. It is a wise provision of nature, precisely
adapted to the desired ends.</p>

<p><i>The Insectivora.</i>—The insect-eaters are more nearly
related to the Rodentia than to the Carnivora. The
form of teeth varies with the species. The incisors and
canines are not especially prominent, but the molars are
always serrated with numerous small-pointed eminences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span>
or cusps, adapted to crushing insects. The three
leading families of the Insectivora are the moles, the
shrew-mice, and the hedgehogs. They are of small
size, and are found in all countries, except in South
America and Australia.</p>

<p><i>The Rodentia.</i>—The Rodentia is a peculiar order of
animals, characterised by two very long and strong teeth
in each jaw, which occupy the place of the incisors and
canines in other animals. Back of these there is a
toothless space, and then four or five molars, which,
when they have a roughened crown, indicate a vegetable,
but when pointed, an insectivorous, diet. Their
principal foods are grains and seeds of all kinds, and
with these, often, fruits, nuts and acorns. To this
order belong the families of the squirrel, marmot, all
species of mice, the beaver, porcupine, hare, and others.</p>

<p>An especial dietetic subdivision of the Rodentia is
the Rhizophaga, or root-eaters, which includes some
species of the Marsupials, and of mice. The food often
consists exclusively of the roots of the beet, carrot, celery
and onion.</p>

<p><i>The Edentata.</i>—Occasionally, though rarely, animals
of this class have rudimentary back teeth. Their food
consists of leaves, blossoms, buds, and juicy stalks.
Some also devour insects, especially ants. To this order
belong the sloth, armadillo, pangolin, and great ant-eater.</p>

<p><i>The Omnivora.</i>—Omnivorous animals have very
distinctive teeth. The canines are markedly developed,
forming regular tusks at the side of the mouth. These
are used for attack and defence, and also to dig up roots,
upon which these animals largely feed. The hog is
typical of omnivorous animals of this character, and we
all know his disposition no less than his anatomy!
Animals of this class can live upon both animal and
vegetable food, and <i>man</i> is supposed to be included in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span>
this category! The great argument brought forward
by those who recommend a “mixed” diet (<i>i.e.</i> one
composed of flesh, vegetables, fruits, roots, grains, etc.),
is that man can live on all these foods, and retain life
and some degree of health, and that therefore he is
omnivorous. We shall come to consider this argument
somewhat at length presently. For the moment, it is
enough to say that (so far as his teeth are considered,
at any rate) man is in no way similar to the hog, or to
any omnivorous animal whatever, but totally different
from all of them. The most casual glance at the mouth
and teeth of the hog should convince us that we are not
in <i>that</i> class! The other considerations we shall come
to later.</p>

<p><i>The Carnivora.</i>—The next great class that we must
consider is the <i>carnivora</i>. Their teeth are very distinctive,
and their shape and arrangement are entirely
different from those of any of the other animals.
There are the incisor teeth in front, and molars behind;
but the most distinctive teeth are the canine, which
especially distinguish this class of feeders. There are
four of these—two in each jaw, placed upon the sides,
and they are long, sharp, and pointed. The more nearly
the animal is purely carnivorous, the more are these
teeth developed, and the less meat the animal eats, the
less are they developed. Thus, the feline species, which
is perhaps the most typically carnivorous of all, have
canine teeth very well developed; in them, they are
most marked. In such animals, the canine teeth are also
set considerably apart from other teeth. In the dog,
however, the teeth are less prominent than they are in
the cat; his claws, eyes, etc., are also less distinctly
carnivorous, and it will be observed that his habits are
decidedly less like those of the preying animal than are
those of the cat: he sleeps at night instead of in the daytime;
does not adopt the stealthy methods for catching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span>
birds, etc., which the cat follows. All this has its significance
when it is remembered that dogs are much more
easily weaned away from a flesh diet, on to one of milk,
bread, biscuits, etc., than are cats, who are very difficult
to wean from their carnivorous habits. This, however,
is by the way.</p>

<p>In the bear family, again, the carnivorous characteristics
are still less marked. The canine teeth are less
and the molars and incisors more developed—the latter
having a flat but roughened crown. All this indicates a
still nearer approach to a vegetable and fruit diet—as is
actually the case. The bear, as is well known, is fond
of berries, fruits of all kinds, milk and honey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Man, has, of course, two “eye teeth,” which are more
or less pointed, and that I do not deny. But these
teeth are comparatively so small, when compared with
the corresponding canines of the real carnivora, as to
be altogether insignificant. When we examine the
mouth of a person with normal teeth, we find that the
teeth are almost exactly similar in size and shape—so
much so, in fact, that any person ignorant of the fact
that we have “carnivorous teeth” in our heads (supposedly)
cannot pick them out from the others! He
does not experience any such difficulty in selecting the
carnivorous teeth of the tiger or the cat! Strange, is
it not? Even the omnivorous hog has teeth so much
larger as to be totally dissimilar to those of man. Man’s
teeth are so uniform that all traces of his carnivorous
nature have entirely disappeared. The only reply that
can be made to this criticism is that, although man’s
carnivorous teeth are considerably smaller than those
of the pure carnivora, they are still <i>there</i>, none the less,
and consequently man is entitled to live upon a <i>certain
amount</i> of meat—though not to make it his chief or exclusive
diet, as do the pure carnivora. The very fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>26</span>
that he has such teeth in his head at all is proof positive,
it will be urged, that man should, or at least <i>can</i>, without
injury, live upon flesh to some extent. For otherwise
how came these teeth into his head?</p>

<p>The answer to this is very simple. The gorilla—a
typical example of the frugivorous animal—has these
teeth much more strongly and markedly developed
than man; and yet he does not feed upon flesh to any
appreciable extent; and in fact lives almost entirely
upon fruits, nuts, roots, etc. If we were to argue that
man must eat meat, because of the carnivorous teeth in
his head, <i>much more</i> must we insist that the orang and
the gorilla should live upon flesh-food—and yet we know
that these animals in their natural state do not eat flesh-foods
at all, or only when they cannot obtain their own
food in abundance! <i>They</i> are clearly frugivorous by
nature; and, inasmuch as their eye-teeth are far more
developed than are the same teeth in man’s head, we
must come to the conclusion that man is certainly not
adapted to a flesh diet, on account of his teeth or because
of them. He is more certainly frugivorous than
the gorilla—were we to judge by the teeth alone! They
are mere rudiments—atrophied relics of bygone ages.
Their use has ceased to be. Orangs and gorillas have
some need of their teeth for purposes of cracking nuts,
for digging up roots, for attack and defence, and perhaps
other purposes in extreme necessity. But <i>we</i>
have no need of teeth for any of these reasons, and
hence the teeth are not developed in us, to any such
great extent. All reason and analogy, therefore, clearly
indicate that our teeth are far more indicative of a
frugivorous diet than any animal living.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can never mention vegetarianism to a flesh-eating
medical gentleman,” said Dr Trall,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “who does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>
introduce the teeth argument as the conclusion of the
whole matter, as he asks triumphantly, ‘What were
carnivorous teeth put in our jaws for if not to eat
flesh?’</p>

<p>“I have an answer. They were never put there at
all! If they really exist in particular cases, it must be
by some accident. They were no part of the original
constitution of humanity. And in truth, they have no
existence at all, except in the imaginations of medical
men—in medical books and journals, in the public newspapers,
and the jaws of carnivorous animals....</p>

<p>“And now I propose to put this matter of teeth to the
proof. Hearing may be believing, but seeing is the naked
truth. I ask medical men to show their teeth; to open
their jaws and let their teeth be seen. Let us have the
light to shine in upon this dark and perplexing question.
I appeal from their statements to their faces; from
their books and schools to their own anatomy.</p>

<p>“Is there a person here who believes that, in the
anatomy of his teeth, he is only part human? that he is
a compromise of human and brute? Let him come
forward and open his mouth.... I think, if we make a
careful examination, we shall readily discover that he is,
‘toothically considered,’ neither perdaceous nor beastial;
that he is, dietetically, neither swinish nor tigerocious;
neither dogmatical nor categorical; nor is he exactly
graminivorous, like the cattle; he is not even sheepish—but
simply, wholly, and exclusively human!</p>

<p>“True, there are some resemblances between the
teeth of men, women and children, and the teeth of
cats, dogs, lions, tigers, hogs, horses, cattle, crocodiles,
and megalosauruses. But there are differences, too!
And the differences are just as significant as are the
resemblances. There is a resemblance between a man’s
face and the countenance of a codfish. There is also
a striking difference. There is some resemblance between
a man’s features—especially if he does not shave—and
the features of a bear. There is some resemblance
between a woman’s hair and a peacock’s feathers;
between a man’s finger-nails and a vulture’s talons;
between his eye-teeth and a serpent’s fangs. But,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span>
luckily for us, they are not the same, nor precisely alike.
Man resembles, more or less, every animal in existence.
He differs, too, more or less, from all animals in existence....</p>

<p>“There is one class of scholars who are competent
and qualified by their studies to give an opinion on the
question of the natural dietetic character of man. I
mean naturalists, who have studied comparative anatomy
with a special reference to this question. And it
gives me pleasure to inform medical gentlemen that
all of them without a single exception, with the great
Cuvier at their head, have testified that the anatomical
conformation of the human being, teeth included, is
strictly frugivorous.</p>

<p>“There are indeed specimens of the human family
who very closely resemble carnivorous animals, not
only in their teeth, but also in their expressions of face
and habits of eating—the Kalmuck Tartars, for example.
But it is precisely because they have for many generations
fed on the grossest animal food and offal, that
their forms and features became coarse, brutal and revolting.
No such example can be found in any nation
or tribe whose dietetic habits have long been wholly
or even chiefly vegetarian. I repeat, if these persistent
advocates of a flesh-diet based on the anatomical argument
will but come forward and let us look into the
interior of their countenances, we will show them that
they are much better than they supposed themselves
to be. We will prove that they are higher in the scale
of being than they have given themselves credit for.
They have been altogether too modest in their pretensions.
In consequence of a little mistake in the anatomy
of their masticators, they have humbled themselves
quite unnecessarily. Instead of ranking themselves
high above the highest, of the animal kingdom, and
close on to the borders of the angel kingdom, where
God placed them, they have degraded themselves to
the level of the scavengers....”</p></div>

<p>Further, it is interesting in this connection to note
that anthropoid apes, as soon as they are deprived of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>29</span>
their natural food and their natural life, soon become
diseased and die. Says Dr Hartmann:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Anthropoids when kept in confinement suffer from
caries of the teeth, and jaws, from chronic and acute
bronchial catarrhs, from inflammation and consumption
of the lungs, from inflammation of the liver, from pericardial
dropsy, from parasites of the skin and intestine,
etc.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p>This is interesting as an illustration of the effects of
perverted living upon apes; and suggests that man
cannot depart from his natural food to any great extent,
either, without dire consequences to himself. The
thousands of sick and dying in every part of the country,
the well-filled hospitals and overflowing graveyards
unfortunately prove this to be the case!</p>

<p>Moreover, the eye-teeth of the anthropoid apes are
of a totally different character from the canine teeth of
the carnivora. The former are small and stout, and
somewhat triangular; while the latter are long, round
and slender. It is a noteworthy fact that the anthropoid
eye-tooth is rough and cartilaginous at the point
of contact between the external tooth and the gum,
while that of the carnivora at the same point is smooth
and sharp. The eye-tooth of the anthropoids is adapted
for use in cracking nuts and the like, while those of the
carnivora are exclusively employed in seizing and
tearing flesh. Professor Nicholson, in his “Manual of
Zoology,” pp. 604-605, says of the anthropoid apes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The canine teeth of the males are long, strong and
pointed, but this is not the case with the females. The
structure, therefore, of the canine teeth is to be regarded
in the light of a sexual peculiarity, and not as having
any connection with the nature of the food.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>30</span></p>
<p>The teeth of man are inferior in strength to those
of the anthropoid apes, but the cause of this is to be
sought not so much in their original character as in the
fact that they have been weakened and degenerated by
the use of cooked food for thousands of years.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be objected that anthropoid apes,
which have been cited as typical frugivorous animals,
are not so much so as I have contended; that, while
their <i>chief</i> food is doubtless fruits and nuts, they do
occasionally feed upon all kinds of substances—roots,
insects, small animals when they can catch them, etc.
Thus Professor Robert Hartmann in his “Anthropoid
Apes” p. 255 says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although they are for the most part content with
vegetable diet, gibbons sometimes eat animal food, such
as lizards; and Bennet saw a siamang seize and devour
one of these animals whole.... They do not, however,
display the keenness of scent and quickness of sight
which distinguish some animals of a lower order; such
as canine beasts of prey and ruminants manifest in
many different ways.” (p. 256).</p></div>

<p>Now, it will be noticed in the above connection that
(1) these apes are, by reason of their peculiar anatomical
and physiological construction, incapable of competing
with the carnivora for food of that character—and hence
naturally disqualified to live upon it; and (2) these
animals do not <i>naturally</i> live upon this food by choice,
when other and, to them, more natural food is forthcoming.
Only in the last stages of hunger do they
resort to food of this nature, which they are obviously
driven to by extremity, and are disqualified to eat
by reason of their peculiar construction. An animal
can be driven to eat anything if he is hungry enough.
That does not prove that what he eats is his natural
food, nevertheless! Instinct, and other considerations,
must determine that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>31</span></p>

<p><i>The Frugivora.</i>—The orang and the gorilla are perhaps
the best examples of this class of animals. Some
bats and kangaroos may be included in it also. Animals
belonging to this class have thirty-two teeth—sixteen
in each jaw; four incisors or cutting teeth; two
pointed teeth, known as cuspids, four small molars,
known as bicuspids, and six molars. The eye-teeth
project somewhat beyond the others and fit into a
blank space in the lower row, the other teeth articulating
uniformly. I have referred to the uses of this large
eye-tooth elsewhere (p. 29).</p>

<p><i>The Teeth of Man.</i>—Now when we come to consider
the teeth of man, we are at once struck by the fact that
they correspond, in almost every particular, with the
teeth of the gorilla and other frugivorous animals; and
the fact they do not at all resemble or correspond
to the teeth of any other animal! To the teeth of
the herbivora, the carnivora, the omnivora, etc., they
bear but the slightest resemblance, while they agree
in almost every respect with the teeth of frugivorous
animals. If we compare the teeth of man with those of
the orang, the gorilla, or other frugivorous animal, we
find that the number, the arrangement, the structure,
the nature, and the size of the teeth are almost identical;
while they bear but the smallest resemblances to the
teeth of any other animal or <i>genera</i>. The complete
absence of intervening spaces between the human teeth
characterises man as the highest and purest example
of the frugivorous animal. Man possesses no long,
canine tooth, capable of catching and holding a captured
prey; he possesses no tusks, like the omnivorous animals,
and in every other way bears no resemblance whatever
to any other animal—while his teeth do bear the very
greatest and most detailed resemblance to the teeth of
the apes and frugivorous animals generally. Bearing all
these facts in mind, then, we surely can have no hesita<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span>tion
in classifying man as a frugivorous animal—so far
as his teeth are concerned. Considered from that point
of view, man must be classed with the pure frugivora.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not only in the number and structure of the teeth,
but also in the manner of masticating the food—in the
movements of the teeth and jaws themselves—there is
a distinct resemblance between man and the apes and
other frugivora, and a radical distinction between him
and all other animals. In herbivorous animals the
jaws have three distinct motions—a vertical, or up-and-down
motion; lateral or sidewise; and forward and
backward. These movements are frequent and free,
the result being that food eaten by these animals undergoes
a thorough grinding process well suited to the
nature of their food. In the carnivorous animals,
on the other hand, the movements of the jaws are in
one direction only—they open and shut “like a pair of
scissors,” as one author said, and are well adapted for
tearing and biting off food that is to be swallowed more
or less <i>en masse</i>, to be acted upon by the powerful gastric
juices of the stomach. No such limited action is the
case with man. With him also the jaws can move in
three directions—as in the case of the herbivora—but
the extent of such motion is much more limited. In
other words, the jaws of man are adapted to a diet
necessitating more or less grinding, and he may be
classed with the herbivora on that account. Whatever
might be said, however, by way of associating man
with the herbivora, he is certainly as distinct as possible
from the carnivora, and resembles other animals far
more than he resembles them. He is certainly <i>not</i>
carnivorous, whatever else he may be!</p>

<p>Having thus passed in review the evidence presented
by the teeth for the naturally frugivorous nature of man,
we must now turn and examine the evidence afforded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span>
by the other organs of the body; and see how far comparative
anatomy affords proof of the nature of man’s
diet—as derived from a study of the other portions of his
bodily frame. I shall review these in turn. First let
us consider the <i>extremities</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Extremities.</i>—According to Huxley, there are
three great divisions in the animal kingdom, as regards
the extremities—viz. those which possess hoofs, those
possessing claws, and those possessing hands. To the
first division belong the herbivora and the omnivora.
Almost all animals possessing claws are carnivorous,
while animals possessing hands are almost invariably
frugivorous. To this rule there are very few exceptions.
Since man certainly belongs to the class possessed of
hands, he is certainly frugivorous by nature. The
reason for this becomes apparent when we stop to consider
the habits of the various animals. The herbivora
have no need for hands; they have merely to walk
about the grassy plains, and partake of what nature
has offered to them in abundance. The carnivorous
animal, on the other hand, takes his food by violence—suddenly
springing upon some defenceless and unresisting
animal, and tearing it to pieces with its sharp teeth
and claws. For this reason they are developed to the
size and extent we see—capable of inflicting such
terrible injuries. And here I would again call attention
to what I said before—as to the carnivorous traits and
characteristics of the cat as compared with those of the
dog. The teeth and claws are far more developed in
the former than in the latter. In man, of course, his
teeth and claws are entirely unfitted for any such office.
The soft, yielding nails are absolutely unlike the long,
sharp claws of the carnivora: nothing could be more
dissimilar. But if we compare the hands and extremities
of man with those of other frugivorous animals, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span>
a very close similarity between them. The reason for
this is that man (like the apes) can and should go out
into the open fields and forests and pick his food off the
trees. The human hand is eminently adapted to this
end and for this purpose; but is quite <i>un</i>adapted for
any such purposes as the claws of the carnivora are
adapted for. I may remark here, incidentally, that all
carnivorous animals <i>drink by lapping up the water</i> or
other liquid with their tongues; while man, and all
vegetarian animals, <i>drink by suction</i>—by drawing up the
fluid directly into the mouth. This is a very distinguishing
characteristic, to which there are few if any
exceptions. Needless to say, since man drinks by
suction, he is eminently a vegetarian animal, and is
quite distinct from the carnivora in <i>this</i> respect, as
in all others.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Alimentary Canal.</i>—“One of the most interesting
comparisons,” says Dr Kellogg,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “which has been
made by comparative anatomists is the length of the
alimentary canal. This is very short in the carnivora,
and long in the herbivora. When compared to the
length of the body of the different classes of animals,
the proportion is found to be as follows:—In the
carnivora, the alimentary canal is three times the length
of the body; in the herbivora, as the sheep, thirty times
the length of the body; in the monkey, twelve times;
in the omnivora ten times; in man, as in the frugivora,
twelve times. Here, as before, we see that anatomy
places man strictly in the frugivorous class. Some
writers have made the amusing blunder of making the
proportionate length of the alimentary canal in man
1 to 6, instead of 1 to 12, by doubling the height through
measuring him while standing erect. This measurement
is evidently wrong, for it includes the length of
the lower extremities, or hind legs, whereas in other
animals the measurement is made from the tip of the
nose to the end of the backbone. In omnivorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span>
animals, the alimentary canal is shorter than in the
apes and in man, thus affiliating this class more nearly
with the carnivora than with the herbivora.</p>

<p>“A curious fact had recently been observed by
Kuttner, as related by him in an article published in
Virchow’s <i>Archives</i>. This author has made extensive
anatomical researches respecting the lengths of the
small intestine in different classes of persons. He finds
that in the vegetarian peasants of Russia, the small
intestine measures from twenty to twenty-seven feet
in length, while among Germans, who use meat in
various forms quite freely, the length of the small
intestine varies between seventeen and nineteen feet.
The author attributes the difference in these two
classes of persons to the difference in diet. Of course
differences of this sort must be the influence of the diet
exerted through many generations. This observation
would seem to suggest that the special anatomical
characteristic of the carnivorous class of animals is due
to the modifying influence of their diet, acting through
thousands of years. If the length of the intestine in
man may be shortened by the use of flesh, with other
foods, for a few hundred years, more extensive modifications
may easily result from the longer experience of
animals that subsist upon an exclusively carnivorous
diet.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>36</span></p>

<p><i>The Stomach.</i>—The position and form of the <i>stomach</i>
are also of significance. In the carnivora, it is only a
small roundish sack, exceedingly simple in structure;
while in the vegetable feeders it is oblong, lies transversely
across the abdomen, and is more or less complicated
with ringlike convolutions—according to the
nature of the food. This appears conspicuously in the
primates, which include man, in the Rodentia, Edentata,
Marsupials, and, above all, in the Ruminants. In the
latter, it presents a series of from four to seven wide,
adjoining and communicating sacks.</p>

<p>At a first superficial glance at the exteriors of the
stomachs of the carnivora and that of man, we apparently
perceive a far closer resemblance than between
man’s stomach and that of a herbivorous animal.
In one sense, there can be no question that there is a
closer similarity; in another sense, it is not so. In man
this organ is simple, but is divided into a cardiac and
pyloric portion—thus occupying, as in many other
anatomical respects, a middle line between the carnivorous
and herbivorous mammalia. The inner surface of
the stomach is covered with <i>rugæ</i>, or wrinkles, formed
by the mucous membrane, which lines the whole intestinal
canal, and which forms valvular folds; while
in the carnivora the stomach is a simple globular sac,
without these corrugations. As Dr Trall observed<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some may imagine, at a first glance, a closer resemblance
between the human stomach and the lion’s
than between the human and that of the sheep. But
when they are viewed in relation to their proper food,
their closer resemblance will vanish at once. It should
be particularly observed that, so far as mere bulk is concerned,
there is a greater similarity between the food
of frugivorous animals and carnivorous animals than
between frugivorous and herbivorous. The digestion
and assimilation of coarse herbage, as grass, leaves, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span>
requires a more complicated digestive apparatus than
grains, roots, etc., and these more so than flesh and
blood. The structure of the stomach, therefore, in
such cases, seems precisely adapted to the food we
assume Nature intended for it.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p><i>The Liver.</i>—Dr John Smith, in calling attention to the
many distinctions between the bodily structure of man
and that of the carnivora, pointed out the following
differences among others:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the carnivora and rodentia, which present the
most complex form of liver among the mammalia, there
are five distinct parts; a central or principal lobe, corresponding
with the principal part of the liver in man;
a right lateral lobe, with a lobular appendage, corresponding
to the ‘lobulus Spigelii’ and the ‘lobus
caudatus,’ and a small lobe or lobule on the left side.
Through the whole animal series, however, the magnitude
of the liver varies in inverse ratio to the lungs.</p>

<p>“In man, the liver is much less developed than the
same organ in many other mammalia; and presents,
as rudimentary indications, certain organs which are in
other animals fully developed. Europeans, and the
inhabitants of Northern climes, who partake more of
animal food, have the liver much larger, and its secretions
more copious, than the inhabitants of warm
climates. Perhaps this, in some measure, depends
upon the amount of non-azotised articles taken along
with the flesh of animals, by which means the system is
supplied with more carbon than is needed. So that
the enlarged liver is attributable to gross living on
mixed diet, rather than to an exclusively animal diet.”</p></div>

<p>This author also says elsewhere (p. 79):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The temporal and masseter muscles, by which the
motion of the lower jaw is effected, are of immense
size in carnivorous animals. The temporal muscle
occupies the whole side of the scull, and fills the space
beneath the zygomatic arch, the span and spring of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span>
which are generally an index of the volume of this
muscle; while the extent and strength of the arch
indicate the development of the masseter muscle. On
the contrary, the pterygoid muscles, which aid the
lateral movement of the jaw, are extremely small. The
zygoma is of great size and strength in the carnivora;
consisting of a long process of the masseter bone, overlaid
by the usual process of the temporal bone, which
is equally strong. The arch extends not only backward
but upward, by the bending down of the extremity;
the line of anterior declination falling precisely
on the centre of the carnassière tooth—the point
in which the force of the jaws is concentrated, and
where it is most required for cutting, tearing, and crushing
their food. In ruminants, the zygomatic arch is
short, and the temporal muscles are small; but the
masseter muscle on each side extends beyond the arch,
and is attached to the greater part of the side of the
maxillary bone. The pterygoid fossa is ample, and its
muscles are largely developed. The arch is small in
man, the temporal muscles moderate, and the force
of the jaws comparatively weak.”</p></div>


<p><i>The Placenta.</i>—Let us now turn to another important
distinction between the carnivorous and non-carnivorous
animals. Of these, perhaps the most important
is the character of the <i>placenta</i>—one of the
most distinguishing marks or characteristics of any
species of animal. This subject has been so well and
ably summed up by Professor Schlickeysen, in his
“Fruit and Bread” (pp. 48-57), that I cannot do better
than quote the main portion of the argument, as stated
by this learned and able author. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We now come to consider the peculiar structure,
form and size of the placenta, as well as the exact
method by which, through it, in different species of
animals, the nourishment is effected. One of the most
striking differences presented in placental animals
relates to the method of union between the mother and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>39</span>
the fœtus. There are two very distinct types of the
placenta, and, according to Professor Huxley, no
transitional forms between them are known to exist.
These types are designated as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The non-deciduate placenta of the Herbivora.</p>

<p>2. The deciduate placenta, of which there are two
kinds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The zonary deciduate placenta of the
Carnivora.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The discoidal deciduate placenta of the
Frugivora.</p></div>

<p>“The deciduate placenta is a distinct structure, developed
from the wall of the uterus, but separated from
it at parturition, and constituting what is known as
the ‘after birth’; of this the human placenta is
regarded by Huxley as the most perfect example;
while, of the non-deciduate placenta, that of the pig
and horse are the typical representatives. The word
‘decidua’ signifies ‘that which is thrown off.’</p>

<p>“<i>The Non-Deciduate Placenta.</i>—This form is thus
described by Professor Huxley: ‘No decidua is
developed. The elevations and depressions of the unimpregnated
uterus simply acquire a greater size and
vascularity during pregnancy, and cohere closely to
the chorionic villi, which do not become restricted to
one spot, but are developed from all parts of the chorion,
except at its poles, and remain persistent in the broad
zone thus formed throughout fœtal life. The cohesion
of the fœtal and maternal placentæ, however, is overcome
by slight maceration; and at parturition the
fœtal villi are simply drawn out, like fingers from a
glove, no vascular substance of the mother being
thrown off.’ To this class belong all the ruminants
and Ungulata (hoofed quadrupeds); the camel, sheep,
goat and deer; the ant-eater, armadillo, sloth, swine,
tapir, rhinoceros, river-horse, sea-cow, whale, and
others.</p>

<p>“<i>The Zonary Deciduate Placenta.</i>—A zonary placenta
surrounds the chorion, in the form of a broad zone,
leaving the poles free. This form characterises all the
land and sea carnivora, and thus includes the cat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>40</span>
hyena, puma, leopard, tiger, lion, fox and wolf; the
dog and bear, the seal, sea-otter and walrus. It includes,
also, certain extinct species, as the mastadon
and dinotherium, which, although not wholly carnivorous,
were, to judge from their teeth, partially so. The
elephant, the only living species of these ancient
animals, is also of this class.</p>

<p>“<i>The Discoidal Deciduate Placenta.</i>—The discoidal
placenta is a highly developed vascular structure, lying
on one side of the fœtus, in the form of a round disc,
leaving the greater part of the chorion free. It is thus
united only on one side, at one circular point, with the
mucous membrane of the uterus, from which, as already
mentioned, it is separated at parturition. The orders
of the animals characterised by this form of placenta
are the rodentia, ant-eaters, bats, and various species
of apes, and man. All these are very closely united
by homologous anatomical forms. The human placenta
does not differ, in its general character, from that of
the others, and there is no good reason for separating
man from his placental classification.”</p></div>


<p><i>Relations between placental forms and Individual
Characteristics.</i>—From our entire knowledge of the
development of races and of individuals, we may
conclude, upon the basis of Huxley’s classification,
that an intimate relation exists between the form and
character of the placenta and the entire nature of the
individual. We find among the non-deciduata, besides
the toothless sloths, only the Ungulata, or hoofed quadrupeds,
and others developed from them. The arrangement
of their teeth, as of their entire digestive apparatus,
marks them as belonging to a single family—namely,
the herbivora.</p>

<p>The zonary placenta characterises a very large family
of animals whose peculiarities are distinctly marked,
especially with regard to their teeth and digestive
apparatus. These belong to the widely diffused and
numerous orders of the carnivora. But the most inter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span>esting
and important group, with reference to our
present study, is that characterised by the discoidal
placenta; for, since it includes man and the fruit-eating
apes, it gives occasion for the comparison between
these and other placental animals from the
standpoint of dietetics.</p>

<p>We observe here at once that the majority of animals
having a discoidal placenta subsist chiefly upon fruits
and grains, and that the typical representatives of this
class, namely, those whose plactental formation is most
distinctly discoidal, are also the most exclusively
frugivorous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, as elsewhere in nature, an exact line cannot be
drawn. Transitional forms exist everywhere, and to
this the placenta is no exception. The most striking
accordance, however, exists between the placenta of
man and that of the tailless apes—namely, the gorilla,
orang, chimpanzee and gibbon. Between other discoidal
species, the differentiation, though minute, is
clearly marked; but between man and these apes the
resemblance is so exact as to stamp them plainly as
members of the same family.</p>

<p>The completely developed placenta is in the form of
a circular disc, about eight inches broad, one inch thick
and weighing about two pounds. Its manner of development
is identical in the human subject and that
of the above-named anthropoid apes. Its exact formation
is thus described by Huxley:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the commencement of gestation, the superficial
substance of the mucous membrane of the human
uterus undergoes a rapid growth and textural modification,
becoming converted into the so-called decidua.
While the ovum is yet small, this decidua is departable
into three portions: The <i>decidua vera</i>, which lines the
general cavity of the uterus; the <i>decidua reflexa</i>, which
immediately invests the ovum; and the <i>decidua<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span>
serotina</i>, a layer of especial thickness, developed in
contiguity with those chorionic villi which persist and
become converted into the fœtal placenta. The <i>decidua
reflexa</i> may be regarded as an outgrowth of the <i>decidua
vera</i> the <i>decidua serotina</i> as a special development
of a part of the <i>decidua vera</i>. At first, the villi of the
chorion are loosely implanted into corresponding impressions
of the <i>decidua</i>; but, eventually, the chorionic
part of the placenta becomes closely united with and
bound to the uterine <i>decidua</i>, so that the fœtal and
maternal structures form one inseparable mass.”</p></div>

<p>The fœtus thus united to the mother is nourished by
means of numerous arterial and venous trunks, which
traverse the deeper substance of the uterine mucous
membrane, in the region of the placenta. These are
connected with the placenta by means of the umbilical
cord, which consists of two arteries and two veins.
The length of this cord is greater in the case of man
and the anthropoid apes than in any other animals,
reaching in them a length of about two feet. The strict
accordance which thus appears between the placental
structure of man and the ape indicates, upon the basis
of Huxley’s principles of classification, the same physiological
functions <i>and the same dietetic character</i>. There
exists a complete similarity between the corresponding
organs in each: Their extremities end in hands and
feet. Their teeth and digestive apparatus indicates a
frugivorous diet. Their breasts and manner of nursing
suggest the same tender care of the new-born creature;
while the brain and mental capacity are also of a
like character—differing only in degree; indeed, the
difference between the ape and animals of the next
lower grade is much greater than between the ape and
man; there being in the latter case really no essential
anatomical or physiological differences.</p>

<p>The fact that man has four cuspid teeth affords no
evidence whatever that he is either partially or wholly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>
carnivorous as regards his dietary. If in diet he is
naturally omnivorous, his teeth should have the structure
and arrangement of those of omnivorous animals—as
exhibited in the hog, for example.</p>

<p>That the cuspid teeth do not indicate a flesh
dietary, either in whole or in part, is shown by the
presence of the so-called cuspids in purely herbivorous
animals—as in the stag, the camel and the so-called
“bridle-teeth” of the horse.</p>

<p>I am convinced that no animals were created
to eat flesh, but that so-called carnivorous animals
were originally nut-eating animals (see p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>).
The squirrel eats birds as well as nuts, which closely
resemble meat in composition. This view readily
explains the close resemblance in many particulars
existing between the human digestive apparatus and
that of the so-called carnivorous animals. It is reasonable
to suppose that these nut-eating animals were at
some remote time forced by starvation to slay, and
eat, by the failure of their ordinary food supply—just
as the horses of the Norwegian coast have been known
to plunge into the sea and catch fish, when driven to
this extremity by starvation. Suppose the carnivorous
animal’s natural diet to be nuts, in the absence of his
normal food he would find nothing else so closely resembling
his ordinary food as the flesh of animals,
since the two have about the same proteid percentages.</p>

<p>Dr Kellogg, in his excellent little book, entitled
“Shall We Slay to Eat?” (pp. 30-32), sums up a number
of remarkable facts in favour of a fruitarian diet,
or at least in favour of a non-flesh diet, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous animals,
the mammary glands are located upon the abdomen,
while in the higher apes and man they are
located on the chest. This is an interesting anatomical
fact to which there is no exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span></p>

<p>“In carnivorous animals the colon is smooth and
non-sacculated. In the higher apes and man the colon
is sacculated. In herbivorous animals the colon is
sacculated, as in man.” (The great importance and
significance of this fact will be apparent presently,
when we come to consider the physiological arguments
against flesh-eating.)</p>

<p>“In carnivorous animals the tongue is very rough,
producing a rasping sensation when coming in contact
with the flesh. In the higher apes and man the tongue
is smooth.</p>

<p>“In carnivorous animals the skin is not provided with
perspiratory ducts—hence the skin does not perspire
in the dog, the cat, and allied animals. In the ape,
the skin is provided with millions of these glands, and
in man they are so numerous that if spread out, their
walls would cover a surface of eleven thousand square
feet. In the pig, an omnivorous animal, only the snout
sweats. In horses, cows and other vegetable-eating
animals, the whole skin sweats, as it does in man.”
(The great importance of this fact will be apparent
when we come to consider the physiological arguments
against a flesh-diet: see p. 55.)</p>

<p>“Carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous animals
are all supplied with an extension of the backbone—a
tail. In the higher apes, as well as in man, the tail
is wanting.</p>

<p>“Carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous animals
go on all fours, and their eyes look on either side, while
many of the higher apes walk nearly or entirely upright,
as does man, and their eyes look forward.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“Carnivorous animals have claws, herbivorous and
omnivorous have hoofs, while apes and men have flat
nails, not found in any other animal. Carnivorous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span>
herbivorous and omnivorous animals are all quadrupeds,
or four-footed, while the higher apes and man are provided
with two hands and two feet. The hinder or
lower extremities of the ape are sometimes erroneously
called hands; according to Dr Huxley, they are, from
both bony and muscular structure, properly classified
as feet, and not as hands.</p>

<p>“In carnivorous animals, the salivary glands are
small, and the saliva which they secrete has little effect
upon starch, while in the apes and man the glands are
well developed and the saliva is active” (see pp. 47-48).</p></div>

<p>In addition to all the facts that have been pointed out,
there are others of lesser interest, but all of which,
nevertheless, go to confirm the fact that man is closely
related to the apes, and consequently intended for a
fruitarian diet, and that he is in no wise related to the
carnivora or <i>their</i> diet. Metchnikoff has summarised
many of these facts, extending the work of Darwin,
Huxley, Haekel, etc. These other, minor, facts might
perhaps be summarised as follows:—</p>

<p>There is an exact agreement between the skeleton of
man and the higher apes—all the bones corresponding,
each to each, while there is a great dissimilarity between
man and any other animal whatever. The nerves, the
viscera, the spleen, the liver, the lungs, the brain, the
skin, nails and hair—all present the closest possible
analogy and similarities. The eyes are strikingly similar,
while the chemical and microscopical character of the
blood is also very similar in man and the higher apes.
This fact is of especial importance and significance, when
we bear in mind that only apes and men are subject to
certain blood diseases—to which all other animals are
impervious. In structure, as in habits, man and the
apes are in many respects remarkably alike, and proportionately
dissimilar to all other animals.</p>

<small>THE ARGUMENT FROM PHYSIOLOGY</small></h2></div>


<p>“After structure—function!” Having seen in the
last chapter that man is constructed throughout for a
diet composed entirely of fruits, nuts, grains, and other
non-flesh foods, we now turn to a consideration of the
functions of the various organs of the body—the
chemical composition of the organic tissues, secretions,
etc.—in order to see if these will further bear us out in
our argument. There can be no question that the most
important argument of all, on this subject of diet, is the
argument based upon comparative anatomy—since that
argument places man in his right class immediately,
and in a manner that cannot be evaded by any amount
of argument. But other aspects of the question are
also of importance, and afford strong proof of the natural
character of man’s diet. The next argument we should
consider, therefore, is the physiological, and we shall
first of all consider the <i>secretions</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Saliva.</i>—The differences between the saliva of
man and that of any of the carnivora is striking. In
man, this secretion is <i>alkaline</i>—though only slightly so,
in a healthy man. Nevertheless, that is its normal
reaction, and to this there is no exception. In the
carnivora, on the other hand, the reaction is <i>acid</i>, and
because of this fact is capable of dissolving the food
more or less whole, and without the long process of
mastication necessary for the herbivora and frugivora.
The saliva in the human being effects many chemical
changes in the food—notable among these being the
conversion of starch. Were man intended to live on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>47</span>
flesh, the saliva would be acid also—instead of alkaline
as it is.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Gastric Juice.</i>—Dr Schlickeysen says of this:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A leading element of the gastric juice is lactic acid.
This excites a slight fermentation of the chyme, and
thus exerts an influence upon the digestion of vegetable,
but not upon that of animal, food. It is far too weak
to act upon the fibres of animal flesh. All fats are insoluble
in water, spirits of wine, and acids. Flesh,
when eaten by man, tends to undergo a process of decay
in the stomach, causing a scrofulous poisoning of the
blood. In this unnatural action lies the cause of many
complaints and disturbances of the system: as bad
breath, heartburn, eructions and vomiting. In the
case of the carnivora, the gastric juice exerts a decomposing
influence upon flesh, and causes its assimilation
and excretion. Since the pancreatic juice of the
duodenum, into which the chyme passes from the
stomach, bears a close resemblance to the saliva, it
follows that the chyme here, also, can have only a
slightly acid property, which it indeed can only have
when it is of a vegetable character. Bile, which is here
poured into the intestines, has only a slight alkaline
reaction, and its use seems to be limited to the prevention
of decay; which, however, can only occur in
the case of flesh-food; so that the effort of nature to
maintain flesh-food in its proper condition by the secretion
of bile must be excessive, and must eventually
cause an excitement and weakening of the whole organism.”</p></div>

<p>And Dr Kellogg has pointed out<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Another property possessed in a high degree by the
gastric juice of carnivorous animals is its antiseptic or
germicidal quality. When exposed to the conditions of
warmth and moisture, flesh, whether that of mammals
birds or fish, readily decomposes or decays, giving rise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>48</span>
to poisonous substances of the most offensive character.
The gastric juice of the dog is capable of preventing
this putrefactive change while the food is undergoing
the process of stomach digestion. That such changes
occur later, however, while the food residue is lying in
the colon previous to expulsion from the body, is
evidenced by the extraordinarily offensive character of
the fæcal matters of this class of animals.”</p></div>

<p>In man, this secretion is very weak, comparatively
speaking, and hence of small value in preventing such
putrefactive changes as those mentioned above. Take
any piece of meat, and expose it for some considerable
period to an environment of heat and moisture, and see
the result! Putrefaction soon occurs—except where
the meat is “embalmed” or preserved by powerful
chemicals—thus rendering it unfit for human food.
But it will be seen that just such conditions prevail in the
human alimentary tract as are most suitable for the
speedy and deadly decomposition of the food eaten;
and, in the case of flesh-foods, the resulting products are
poisonous in the last degree. The gastric juice of the
human stomach being so far weaker than that of the
carnivorous animal, the flesh is far less completely
acted upon and digested in the stomach—much more
work being passed on to the intestines, in consequence.
Now comes in a most important factor. The bowel of
the carnivorous animal is, as we have seen, <i>short</i>, (three
times the length of the body) when compared to the
frugivora, whose alimentary tract is about twelve times
the length of the body. That is, the digestive tract in
man is, roughly, about four times as long as in the
carnivorous animal. The result of this is that any food
eaten would take, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, four times as long to
pass through the tube in the one case as in the other.
This fact alone is sufficient to condemn the use of flesh-foods
in any form for frugivorous animals, since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span>
less active antiseptic and germicidal properties of the
gastric juice in these animals render unsafe the long retention
of such easily decomposable substances as flesh.</p>

<p>But more than that, and worse still; the character
of the internal structure of the tract is not alike in the
two cases! In the carnivora, this is smooth, and offers
but few impediments to the free passage of the food
through it. In man, on the contrary, as with the higher
apes and the herbivora, the intestine is corrugated or
sacculated—this being for the express purpose of retaining
the food as long as possible in the intestine, and
until all possible nutriment has been abstracted from
it. This is admirably suited to such foods as the herbivora
and frugivora enjoy, but is quite <i>un</i>suited for
flesh-foods of all kinds—being, in fact, the worst possible
receptacle for such foods. The intestine, in the carnivora,
is suited for its particular food—it is short and
smooth, and well adapted to dissolve the food quickly
and pass it out of the system as rapidly as possible;
while in frugivora, on the other hand, the intestine is
adapted to retain the food a much longer time—the
sacculated surface retaining the food as long as possible.
The result of this is that, when flesh-foods are eaten,
disastrous results are sure to follow.</p>

<p>As previously shown, the <i>liver</i> is much larger, proportionately,
in the carnivora; and not only is this
the case, but the amount of bile secreted is far greater
in the carnivora than in man. It has been found, by
careful experiments upon dogs, that the quantity of
bile might increase fifty per cent., and even more, under
a purely meat diet; but rapidly decreased when the
quantity and proportion of the meat was reduced. Thus
it appears that the use of a meat diet requires a far
greater degree of activity on the part of the liver than
any other diet. This is amply provided for in the
carnivore by the increased size and power of that organ,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span>
but in man and the frugivora such is not the case, and
the result is that if meat be eaten by man, the liver is
called upon to do an extra amount of work, and this
may ultimately result in its premature breakdown.</p>

<p>The <i>kidneys</i> also are greatly affected by the diet. It
is now well known that uric acid is created in large
quantities by a flesh diet—the measured excretions
showing that from three to ten times as much uric acid
is secreted when flesh is eaten as when no meat is ingested;
and when we bear in mind the exceedingly disastrous
effects of uric acid upon the system, and what
a powerful disease-producing agency it is, I think
that we must conclude that this symptom is strongly
suggestive, and strongly indicative of the fact that man
cannot eat meat without running grave chances of
diseasing and ruining his organism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Excretions.</i>—There is also a marked difference in
the excretory products of the various animals. While, in
the carnivora, the action of the urine is acid, it is alkaline
in the herbivora (or should be). In man it is frequently
acid—though this varies with the nature of the food.
Thus, if the diet be largely one of flesh, the urine will
become far more acid, and will also become very offensive;
the perspiration will also be tainted, and very
noticeable to those with a keen sense of smell, and who
do not eat meat themselves! This has frequently been
observed, and may account for the fact that flesh-eating
animals will always eat a horse or a sheep in preference
to man, if it be possible. Doubtless, their keen sense
of smell detects the fact that man is (usually) largely
carnivorous in his habits, and their instinct teaches
them that the flesh of the purely herbivorous animal
is for this reason superior to that of man. Has anyone
thought why it is that a cat will kill a mouse, <i>and eat it</i>,
while a dog will kill a cat, but will <i>not</i> eat it? It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span>
because the mouse is a vegetarian animal, and the cat
is a carnivorous animal. Instinct teaches the cat that
the tissues of the mouse’s body are more or less pure and
inoffensive—owing to the nature of the diet; while
the same instinct teaches the dog that the cat’s body
is impure and more or less poisonous, for the reason
that <i>its</i> flesh is tainted and full of poisons, because of its
diet. If any animal lives upon flesh, that animal’s
body is bound to be tainted more or less in consequence;
and those animals which prey upon others know that
fact, by reason of their sense of smell and instinct. This
is a remarkable and most instructive fact; a rule which
will rarely be found to fail. Its significance and interpretation
is obvious. Professor Schlickeysen also informs
us that “the overloading of the blood with flesh-food
causes, in order to effect their decomposition, an
excessive consumption of oxygen, and hence the difficulty
of breathing, and asthmatical affections of many
flesh-eaters, and their excessive excretion of carbonic
acid.” I have referred to some of these poisons, formed
within the system, and the harm they must doubtless
exert upon the organism, elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to all these arguments, there are other
forcible reasons for considering man as one of the non-flesh-eating
animals—which reasons may be included
in this chapter. The <i>habits</i> of any animal are distinctive;
and they, collectively, indicate man’s position—though
this argument must always be confirmatory, and not
proof in itself. For instance, all naturally carnivorous
animals sleep in the daytime, and prowl about in search
of their prey at night; while with the vegetarian animals
(man included) this is not the case. The manner of
eating and especially of drinking, is also highly characteristic—all
carnivorous animals <i>lapping</i> their liquids—while
the herbivora and frugivora drink—as I have
previously pointed out. The peculiar mode of function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>52</span>ing
of various organs might also be pointed out and
insisted upon. But one of the most striking arguments
is that based upon the anatomical structure of the <i>skin</i>.
As before stated, this perspires, in the case of all vegetarian
animals, while the glands are atrophied and inactive
in all carnivora. Let us now consider the significance
of this fact.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Recent researches show us that uric acid arises
from the decay of cell nuclei. That portion of uric acid
which has its origin in the digestive organs is, like other
alloxanic bases, changed into urea—or rather should be.
But a diseased liver (or a healthy one which is overworked,
owing to an excessive ingestion of food containing
cell nuclei, and therefore an excessive amount of
uric acid) is unable to transform all the uric acid formed
into urea. The quantity of uric acid arising from the
normal decay of the tissue is small; in fever, when there
is a more rapid decay of cells, the quantity of uric acid
and other related alloxanic bodies is considerably increased.
The greater the quantity of useless body-material,
and the worse (more dysæmic) it is in quality,
the greater is the danger of a more rapid decay of cells,
and a precipitation of uric acid and related products
taking place.... The uric acid, passing through the
liver, may perhaps be transformed into urea by a special
action of the cells; but the uric acid drawn directly
from the digestive canal, and that formed directly from
the assimilated food or from the body-material, has
to be oxidised, in order to be excreted in the innocuous
form of urea. An organism possessed of the faculty
of oxidation is protected against a precipitation of uric
acid, but in a dysæmic organism, the faculty of transforming
uric acid into urea is lessened.... It is a fact
well worth considering that the urine of carnivorous
animals—<i>e.g.</i> dog and cat—is often quite free from uric
acid, while human urine varies in this respect according
to the food taken: if vegetable food alone is consumed,
the urine will contain, like the urine of herbivorous
animals, only traces of uric acid (from ·2 to ·7 grammes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>53</span>
in 24 hours); but if a large proportion of flesh-food be
taken, the urine will contain 2 grammes or more. Man
is the only creature which suffers from the uric acid
diathesis; is it not likely that this arises from a wrong
choice of food?</p>

<p>“Now, if the excretion of the uric acid always took
place easily, we should not have much trouble about
its formation, but it is this excretion which constitutes
the difficulty. Uric acid and the acid salts of the uric
acid dissolve with difficulty in cold water; but more
easily in warm; still, one gramme of uric acid requires
from 7 to 8 litres of water at the temperature of the
body for its solution. The acid urate of soda dissolves
in 1100 parts of cold and 124 parts of boiling water.
The ammonia salts and the salts of the alkaline earths
do not dissolve nearly so easily.</p>

<p>“The ‘warm water’ which keeps the uric acid and
the uric acid salts dissolved in the body is the blood
and tissue fluids. Serious disturbances must take place
if this fluid becomes cooler or diminished in quantity;
for a deposit of crystalline uric acid would occur in the
body.</p>

<p>“A person who has to daily excrete 2 grammes of
uric acid, is constantly liable to this precipitation, as
he may at any time lose large quantities of water
through perspiration. It is, therefore, undoubtedly
safer to have the uric acid combined with soda, as an
acid urate; but where is soda to be obtained if it is
absent from the blood, owing to dysæmia?</p>

<p>“The more acid the urine is, the more easily will a
precipitation of the uric acid occur in the organism—for
instance, in the kidneys or bladder. The urine of a
person eating flesh contains a large amount of uric acid,
as we have seen before; it is also strongly acid in reaction
whereas the urine of herbivorous animals is
generally alkaline in reaction....</p>

<p>“A very acid urine rich in uric acid is also produced
by salt meat and salt fish, because in the process of
salting, the basic salts (basic alkaline phosphates and
carbonates) pass into the pickle water and neutral
common salt takes their place. Russian physicians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>54</span>
have told me that in certain parts of Russia, where the
people eat a great deal of salt fish, urine stones are
frequent.... Now, if we wish to prevent by the use
of alkalies the formation of uric acid sediments, or
gradually to dissolve such concretions as have already
formed in the bladder, it is certainly more rational
to prescribe a diet of fruits and potatoes than to order
alkaline mineral waters—which, when taken constantly,
may produce all sorts of disturbances.</p>

<p>“If, then, it is true that our ordinary diet consists
chiefly of foods rich in albumen and phosphoric acid
but poor in soda, and that in consequence of this a
tendency towards the accumulation of uric acid in the
body is pretty generally found, the very slightest extra
strain on the system will be sufficient to cause a precipitation
of uric acid and uric acid salts in the body.
This result is very often brought about by a chronic
acid catarrh of the stomach, which in its turn depends
upon dysæmia, and is in 95 out of 100 cases the predecessor
of gout. The fermentation acids, especially
oxybutyric acid (which is found in the urine both in
acid catarrh of the stomach and in diabetes mellitus),
combine with some of the alkalies of the blood, and
thus lessen its alkalescence (basic character); and as
catarrh of the bowels and periodic diarrhœas are frequently
associated with acid catarrh of the stomach,
these bases may be even directly excreted in the stools,
and thus the quantity of alkalies in the blood be further
diminished.</p>

<p>“Now we find that men consuming vegetable food
form only small quantities of uric acid, herbivorous
animals as well as carnivorous hardly any, but men
living on flesh-food very large quantities, we must come
to the conclusion that <i>men cannot properly manage
flesh-food</i>. The organism of the flesh-eating animal has
the faculty of completely digesting flesh-food, whereas
the organism of man is unable to accomplish this.
Consequently man cannot be classed as carnivorous
and cannot eat flesh unpunished....</p>

<p>“To illustrate this further, we may mention another
important point here. Carnivorous animals have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>55</span>
atrophied, inactive sweat glands, whilst man and
herbivorous animals possess well-developed sweat
glands. There is no doubt, therefore, that <i>the herbivora
must have preceded the carnivora in point of time</i>—the
carrion feeders being the connecting link between
them.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The carnivora have retained the sweat glands
as atrophied (rudimentary) organs, and as a sign of
their origin, but have given up the habit of sweating,
or, in other words, have adapted their skin to the
changed conditions of feeding. An animal whose food
contains large quantities of urea as well as of creatin,
creatinin, xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanin, etc. (the early
stages of uric acid), and thus increases the quantity
of urea and uric acid already present in the body, must
take care always to keep these substances in solution.
But the urea and uric acid can only be dissolved in
comparatively large quantities of warm water (blood).
Such an animal must, therefore, be exempt from the
possibility of suddenly losing a large part of its blood
and tissue fluid by sweating—or else a precipitation
of the above substance will take place. Nor should an
organism allow of any sudden cooling down of portions
of the skin—such as might be caused by evaporation
of the sweat, or else a precipitation would again take
place. In a word, such an animal must not be subject
to sweating, or else it would be troubled with acute
and chronic rheumatism, gout, etc....</p>

<p>“Now as man <i>is</i> subject to sweating, it is evident
that he was not intended to live on flesh, but on vegetables,
or rather on fruits, for he was never meant to
live on cereals.... Man may eat a limited amount
of meat and cereals without doing himself much harm;
but he must always remember that they ought never
to form his principal food.</p>

<p>“As soon as it is really understood that we were
never intended to live on flesh and cereals, the uric acid
diathesis as a trouble of mankind will disappear. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span>
must, of course, not forget to restrict the consumption
of common salt and to use such vegetable foods as are
rich in food salts, and not those which are rich in albumen;
for a diet consisting of bread, pulses, and
cereals, and potatoes will tend to produce gout just as
much as a diet consisting of flesh, fish and <i>caviare</i>....”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>It is only by reason of the excessive functioning of
the liver that we are not soon poisoned, as the result
of such food, and when this organ is constantly over-taxed,
as it often is, for a lifetime, it is apparent that
it must sooner or later break down, and be ruined from
overwork.</p>

<small>THE ARGUMENT FROM CHEMISTRY</small></h2></div>


<p>Having seen in the preceding chapters that man is
adapted by nature of his constitution to live upon
vegetable foods (meaning by this latter term not only
vegetables, but fruits and nuts as well), we must next
turn to a consideration of the question as to whether
these foods would supply all the necessary elements for
the nutrition of the human body. The bodily tissues
being in a constant state of flux—worn-out particles
of the body being continuously thrown off by means
of the various eliminating organs, and fresh material
constantly taking their place and being built into
living tissue—it is obvious that the nature of this
material supplied to the body should be of the best in
quality; and that best adapted to maintain its structural
integrity. If certain elements are lacking in the
food material supplied, these elements will be lacking
throughout every stage of the process of digestion,
and the tissues ultimately become impoverished because
of the lack of them. The chief reason why we eat
meat (apart from mere custom), is that it contains a
fairly large percentage of proteid—that material from
which the muscles are largely built, and which physiologists
have lately come to believe is one of the true
sources of the bodily energy. Meat being a highly
concentrated article of food, and, as before said, containing
a large percentage of this proteid, it has always
been considered necessary that more or less of it should
be consumed in the course of the day in order to offset
or replace the wastes necessitated by physical exercise
and other causes. Professor Russell H. Chittenden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>58</span>
in speaking of the value of proteid in the human body
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The organic substance of all organs and tissues,
whether of animals or plants, is made up principally
of proteid matter.... Proteid substances occupy,
therefore, a peculiar position in the nutrition of man
and of animals in general. They constitute a class of
essential food-stuffs without which life is impossible.
For tissue building, and for the renewal of tissues and
organs, or their component cells, proteid or albuminous
food-stuffs are an absolute requirement. The vital
part of all tissue is proteid, and only proteid food can
serve for its growth or renewal; hence, no matter how
generous the supply of carbohydrates and fats, without
some admixture of proteid food, the body will weaken
and undergo ‘nitrogen starvation....’ It is thus
quite clear that the true proteid foods are tissue builders
in the broadest sense of the term, and it is equally
evident that they are absolutely essential to life, since
no other kind nor form of food-stuff can take their
place in supplying the needs of the body. Every living
cell, whether of heart, muscle, brain or nerve requires
its due allowance of proteid material to maintain its
physiological rhythm. No other food-stuff stands in
such intimate relationship to the vital processes; and,
so far as we know at present, any form of true proteid,
whether animal or vegetable, will serve the purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>It will be seen from the above, therefore, that proteid
is doubtless the most essential element in our diet;
and a lack of proteid material in the food ensures more
disastrous consequences to the organism than any other
single deviation from a normal diet. Meat, as we have
said, contains a large percentage of proteid, and, this
being the case, it is evident that, if we are to discard it
as an article of diet, we must replace it by other foods
which contain an equal amount of proteid, or must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>59</span>
eat a proportionate bulk of foods which contain proteid,
in order to maintain that physiological equilibrium
which ensures health.</p>

<p>The simplest, and in fact the <i>only</i> way to settle this
question, therefore, is to compare the chemical analyses
of the various food-stuffs, and see if any non-flesh foods
contain as much proteid as meat does. If they do, and
if it can be shown, further, that their proteid is as
easily assimilable and as nutritious as animal proteid,
then the case will have been won—for the reason that
there will no longer be any grounds for defending flesh-eating,
upon the basis that that is the only article of
diet capable of supplying the body with the requisite
amount of proteid. I shall take these chemical analyses
from the latest official bulletins—those issued under
the supervision of the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
and corrected up to 1908. The bulletin from which I
quote these tables is entitled “The Chemical Composition
of American Food Materials,” and is written
jointly by Professors W. O. Atwater and A. P. Bryant.
These authors first of all define what they mean by the
“composition of food materials,” as follows:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Composition of Food Materials</span></p>

<p>“Ordinary food materials, such as meat, fish, eggs,
potatoes, wheat, etc., consist of:</p>

<p>”<i>Refuse.</i>—As the bones of meat and fish, shells of
shellfish, skin of potatoes, bran of wheat, etc.</p>

<p>“<i>Edible portion.</i>—As the flesh of meat and fish, the
white and yolk of eggs, wheat flour, etc. This edible
portion consists of water (usually incorporated in the
tissue and not visible as such), and nutritive ingredients
or nutrient.</p>

<p>“The principal kinds of nutritive ingredients are
protein, fats, carbohydrates, and ash or mineral
matters.</p>

<p>“The water and refuse of various foods and the salt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>60</span>
salted meat and fish are called non-nutrients. In comparing
the values of different food materials for nourishment
they are left out of account.</p>

<p>”<i>Protein.</i>—This term is used to include nominally the
total nitrogenous substance of animal and vegetable
food materials, exclusive of the so-called nitrogenous
fats. Actually it is employed, in common usage, to
designate the product of the total nitrogen by an empirical
factor, generally 6.25.</p>

<p>“This total nitrogenous substance consists of a great
variety of chemical compounds, which are conveniently
divided into two principal classes, proteids and non-proteids.</p>

<p>“The term proteid, as here employed, includes (1) the
simple proteids—<i>e.g.</i> albuminoids, globulins, and their
derivations, such as acid and alkali albumins, coagulated
proteids, proteoses, and peptones; (2) the so-called
combined or compound proteids; and (3) the so-called
gelatinoids (sometimes called “glutinoids”) which are
characteristic of animal connective tissue.</p>

<p>“The term albuminoids has long been used by
European and American chemists and physiologists as
a collective designation for the substances of the first
two groups, though many apply it to all three of these
groups. Of late a number of investigators and writers
have employed it as a special designation for compounds
of the third class.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>“The term non-proteid is here used synonymously
with non-albuminoid, and includes nitrogenous animal
and vegetable compounds of simpler constitution than
the proteids. The most important animal compounds of
this class are the so-called “nitrogenous extractives”
of muscular and connective tissue, such as creatin,
creatinin, xanthin, hypoxanthin, and allied cleavage
products of the proteids. To some of these the term
“meat bases” has been applied. The latter, with
certain mineral salts (potassium phosphates, etc.), are
the most important constituents of beef tea and many
commercial “meat extracts.”</p>

<p>“The non-proteid nitrogenous compounds in vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>61</span>
foods consist of amids and amido acids, of which asparagin
and aspartic acid are familiar examples.</p>

<p>“The ideal method of analysis of food materials would
involve quantitative determinations of the amounts of
each of the several kinds or groups of nitrogenous compounds.
This, however, is seldom attempted. The
common practice is to multiply the percentage of nitrogen
by the factor 6.25 and take the product as representing
the total nitrogenous substance. For many
materials, animal and vegetable, this factor would be
nearly correct for the proteids, which contain, on the
average, not far from 16 per cent. of nitrogen, although
the nitrogen content of the individual proteids is quite
varied. The variations in the nitrogen of the non-proteids
are wider and they contain, on the average, more
than 16 per cent. of nitrogen. It is evident, therefore,
that the computation of the total nitrogenous substance
in this way is by no means correct. In the flesh of meats
and fish, which contain very little of carbohydrates, the
nitrogenous substance is frequently estimated by difference—<i>i.e.</i>
by subtracting the ether extract and ash from
the total water-free substance. While this method is
not always correct, it is oftentimes more nearly so than
the determination by use of the usual factor.</p>

<p>“The distinction between protein and proteids is thus
very sharp. The latter are definite chemical compounds
while the former is an entirely arbitrary term used to
designate a group which is commonly assumed to include
all of the nitrogenous matter of the food except the
nitrogenous fats.</p>

<p>“In the tables herewith the common usage is followed,
by which the protein is given as estimated by factor,
<i>i.e.</i>, total nitrogen multiplied by 6.25. In the analyses
of meats and fish, however, the figures for protein ‘by
difference’ are also given. Where the proteid and
non-proteid nitrogenous matter have been estimated
in a food material the proportions are indicated in a
footnote.</p>

<p>“<i>Fats.</i>—Under fats is included the total ether extract.
Familiar examples of fat are fat of meat, fat of milk
(butter), oil of corn, olive oil, etc. The ingredients of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>62</span>
the ‘ether extract’ of animal and vegetable foods and
feeding stuffs, which it is customary to group roughly as
fats, include with the true fats various other substances,
as fatty acids, lecithins (nitrogenous fats), and chlorophylls.</p>

<p>“<i>Carbohydrates.</i>—Carbohydrates are usually determined
by difference. They include sugars, starches,
cellulose, gums, woody fibre, etc. In many instances
separate determinations of one or more of these groups
have been made. The determinations of ‘fibre’ in
vegetable foods, <i>i.e.</i>, substances allied to carbohydrates
but insoluble in dilute acid and alkali, and somewhat
similar to woody fibre, are given in a separate column.
The figures in parenthesis in the crude-fibre column
show the number of analyses in which the fibre was
determined. The figures for ‘total carbohydrates’
include the fibre, as well as sugars, starches, etc. Where
the sugars or starches have been determined separately
footnotes are added giving the average results.</p>

<p>“<i>Ash or Mineral Matters.</i>—Under this head are included
phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, and other salts of
potassium, sodium, magnesium, and other metallic
elements. Where analyses of the mineral matters have
been found they are added in the form of footnotes.
These results usually give the percentage composition of
the ash as produced by incineration rather than the
proportions in which the different mineral ingredients
occur in the food material.</p>

<p>“<i>Fuel Value.</i>—By fuel value is meant the number of
calories of heat equivalent to the energy which it is
assumed the body would be able to obtain from one
pound of a given food material, provided the nutrients
of the latter were completely digested. The fuel values
of the different food materials are calculated by use of
the factors of Rubner, which allow 4.1 calories for a gram
of protein, the same for a gram of carbohydrates, and
9.3 calories per gram of fats. These amounts correspond
to 18.6 calories of energy for each hundredth of a
pound of protein and of carbohydrates, and 42.2 calories
for each hundredth of a pound of fat in the given food
material. In the following table the fuel value per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>63</span>
pound has been calculated by use of these factors.
In these calculations the values of protein by factor
have been used in all cases with the exception of salt
cod and hens’ eggs, in which the value of protein by
difference was used.”</p></div>

<p>I now present a few extracts from these lengthy tables
of the chemical composition of food materials—mentioning,
first, some typical meats, then fishes, vegetables,
grains, flours, etc., dairy products, fruits, nuts, and
various sundries. I take but a few of each, in order to
show the typical proteid value of the various foods,
without making these tables too long; and the reader
can readily see, by referring to the column of proteid
percentage, that many articles of diet contain a far
<i>larger</i> percentage of proteid than the best meats! I
present the tables, however, before discussing this
question at greater length.</p>

<p class="center">See the <a href="#Displaced_Table">Displaced Table</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>71</span></p>

<p>In the above selections from Atwater and Bryant’s
tables, I have chosen, in every case, the <i>best parts</i> or cuts
of the meat, and those meats which are supposedly most
nutritious, to balance against my selected list of vegetables,
etc.—containing the highest percentage of protein.
If the tables be examined carefully, the following astonishing
facts will be brought to light:—That while in
lean ribs of beef (considering only the edible portion)
we find that the protein percentage is but 19.6, with a
fuel value per pound of 870; that while cooked mutton
contains a protein percentage of 25.0, with a fuel value
of 1420 cal. per pound, almonds (nuts) contain a protein
percentage of 21.0, with a fuel value of 3030! Again,
we find a protein percentage of 27.9, with a fuel
value of 3165 for butter-nuts; a protein percentage of
25.8, with a fuel value of 2560 for peanuts; a protein
value of 27.6 and a fuel value of 3105 for black walnuts;
and a protein value of 16.6 and a fuel value of 3285 for
California walnuts (to mention but a few instances).
The protein percentage of ribs of beef is but 17.8! Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>72</span>
cocoa, as purchased, contains a far greater protein
percentage and a higher fuel value than the choicest
portions of almost all meats—for it contains a protein
percentage of 21.6 and a fuel value of 2320! This is
to be compared, be it observed, with, say, a protein
percentage of 17.8 and a fuel value of 1330 for ribs of
beef—this being the average for all analyses. Many
meats fall far below beef and mutton, which have been
cited as standard and sample meats—while only the
lean and edible portions have been used for purposes of
calculation. Were we to compare the protein percentages
and fuel values of other meats, and especially
game and fish, we should find that they fall far below,
not only nuts, but also grains and the legumes, in both
protein percentage and fuel values. For instance, we
find that fricasseed chicken, taking the edible portion
only, contains a protein percentage of 17.6 and a fuel
value per pound of but 885; that the edible portion of
bass contains but 18.6 protein, with a fuel value of 465;
that cod contains but 16.5 protein percentage, with a
fuel value of 325, as against a protein percentage of
22.5 with a fuel value of 1600 for dried beans—against
a protein percentage of 25.7, and a fuel value of 1620 of
dried lentils, and as against 24.6 protein percentage, and
a fuel value of 1655 for dried peas! The comparison is
astonishing. Even evaporated potatoes contain an
average of 8.5 protein percentage, with a fuel value of
1680, as against a protein percentage of 6.2 with a fuel
value of 235 for oysters; and a protein percentage of
4.6, with a fuel value of 150 for mussels! Hens’ eggs
contain a large proportionate percentage of protein;
the average being 13.4, with a fuel value of 720; but
this must be balanced against a protein percentage of
28.8 for American cheese, with a fuel value of 2055;
or a protein percentage of 25.9 with a fuel value of
1950 for cream cheese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>73</span></p>

<p>As against the figures just quoted, let me cite two or
three analyses of meat soups, which have frequently been
administered to invalids under the idea that they are
“strengthening” and “heating”—thus supporting or
maintaining the temperature and the energy of the sick
person. Apart from the fundamental error contained
in this theory—that we <i>do</i> derive our strength and the
heat of the body from the food eaten (which I have endeavoured
to prove incorrect in my “Vitality, Fasting
and Nutrition,” pp. 225-303; 332-350; 448-459; etc.),
there is the direct evidence afforded by the chemical
analysis of these articles of diet. As opposed to an
average of more than 20.0 protein percentage, and a
fuel value averaging more than 1600 calories, we find
for beef soup, as purchased, a protein percentage of 3.2
and a fuel value of 295; a protein percentage of 1.8,
and a fuel value of 195, for clam chowder; and a protein
percentage of 4.6 and a fuel value of 370 for ordinary
meat stew! Quite apart, therefore, from the argument
based upon the fact that all meat juices and extracts
contain, in addition to the nutritious principles,
a large amount of poisonous or toxic material, we have
here direct evidence of the fact that these meat soups, so
generally administered to invalids, are totally lacking
both in high protein value and in fuel value; and when
we consider that, in addition to all this, they contain a
large amount of poisonous matter in solution, it will
be seen how false is the doctrine of administering soups
of this character to patients, under the impression that
we are helping them to sustain their bodily heat, their
energies and their strength!</p>

<p>Let us now make another short list of comparisons.
Fresh ham, medium fat, average edible portion, contains
15.3 protein percentage, with a fuel value of
1505; dried cow peas, on the other hand, have a protein
percentage of 21.4, with a fuel value of 1590. Leg of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>74</span>
veal averages a protein percentage of 20.7, with a fuel
value of 670; as against a protein percentage of 18.1,
and a fuel value of 1625 for lima beans; leg of lamb,
medium fat, edible portion only, averages 19.2 protein
percentage, with a fuel value of 1055; compared with
a protein percentage of 33.9 and a fuel value of 2845 for
pignolia-nuts. Again, we compare a protein percentage
of 23.9, and a fuel value of 875, for sirloin steak, with a
protein percentage of 29.3, and a fuel value of 2825
for pea-nut butter, as purchased! If we compare all the
analyses of loin of beef, we find the average for the edible
portion to be 19.0 protein percentage, and a fuel value
of 1155; while the protein percentage of this same
article of diet, as purchased, would be but 16.4, with a
fuel value of 1020, as against a protein percentage of
28.1, and a fuel value of 2945 for Sabine pine-nuts; even
“malted nuts” contain a protein percentage of 22.7,
with a fuel value of 2240—this being far ahead of all but
a few meats. And many of the grains are equal, both
in protein percentage and in fuel value, to many of the
best meats. Thus, rolled oats contain a protein percentage
of 16.7, and a fuel value of 1850; gluten wheat
flour, a protein percentage of 14.2, with a fuel value of
1665; while, turning to the vegetables, we find a protein
percentage of more than 20 per cent. (often running up
as high as 25) and a fuel value averaging 1600 calories
per pound, for all the bean and pea family. Practically
all the nuts contain a far larger percentage of protein
than any meats, while even such articles of food as
chocolate and yeast, contain an equal amount (12.9
and 11.7)! It will be seen from the above tables, therefore,
that so far as protein is concerned, the same amount
may be extracted from an equal amount of other foods,
and even a far greater amount of protein from a lesser
quantity of other foods. This being the case, it becomes
obvious how absurd it is to talk of the necessity of meat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>75</span>
as an article of diet, because of the large amount of
protein it contains. But since, as we have seen, the
chief object (if not the <i>only</i> one) for our eating meat at
all is to obtain this protein in what has always been
thought to be a “readily digestible and condensed”
form, it will be seen that there is no basis whatever for
this belief, and that it is, in fact, totally disproved by
the direct evidence in the case. We can obtain all the
protein we need from an equal or lesser quantity of food
of non-animal origin.</p>

<p>Let us now briefly examine the other constituents of
food, in order to see if the requisite amount of fats,
carbohydrates, salts, etc., are supplied. As before
stated, our chief reason for eating meat at all is
that it is supposed to contain a larger percentage
of protein than any other article of diet; but we have
seen that this is not the case. It is generally conceded
by all those who defend a “mixed,” or partly flesh diet,
that vegetable foods and fruits will supply all the fats
and carbohydrates needed by the system—the percentage
of protein being always the point in
dispute.</p>

<p>However, in order to make this perfectly plain to the
reader, I shall adduce a few examples of the various
food-stuffs, in order that it can be seen at once that all
these other constituents of food are likewise contained,
in far greater quantities than they are in meat, in
almost all other articles of diet. A few examples will
render this clear.</p>

<p>First of all, let us take the fats. In the edible portion
of very fat beef we have a percentage of 32.3 and 27.6
per cent. fat on the edible portion of fat loin of beef. We
find a percentage of 35.6 fat on fat ribs of beef. But
when beef is cooked, as it must be before eating, we
find the amount of this fat greatly reduced. Thus
sirloin steak contains but 10.2 per cent. of fat; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>76</span>
edible portion of tenderloin averages 20.4 per cent.;
roast beef averages 28.6 per cent.; veal contains an
average of but 7.7 per cent., for the edible portion; fat
leg of lamb, edible portion, 27.4 per cent.; but when it
is cooked, there is here, as in all other cases, a great reduction
in the percentage of fat—there remaining but
12.7 per cent. in roast leg of lamb. The percentage in
mutton is somewhat higher, being 22.6 per cent., as
cooked. Ham, of course, contains a large amount of
fat; fresh ham, edible portions, medium fat, averaging
28.9 per cent., the total average for fresh ham being
33.4 per cent. When ham is cooked, however, there is
the invariable reduction in the percentage, being especially
noticeable in this case—the average of luncheon
ham, cooked, being but 21.0 per cent. Poultry and
game contain a smaller percentage of fat than most
meats. Capon, chicken, and roast turkey average
from 10 per cent. to 11 per cent. in fat. All fresh
fish and shellfish contain very much less fat, from 1
per cent. to 2 per cent. on the average. Eggs contain
about half the percentage contained in meat, as a rule,
the average being 10.5 per cent. for the edible portion.
There is a great disproportion, however, between the
white and the yolk of the egg; there being but .2 per
cent. of fat in the edible portion of the white, while
33.3 per cent. of the edible portion of the yolk is fat.</p>

<p>Now, when we turn to dairy products and to the
vegetable kingdom for our fats, we find that a very
large amount of fat is contained in a number of articles
of diet—far greater than in any of the fattest meats.
Thus, butter contains 85 per cent. fat; American
cheese, 38.3 per cent. fat; California cheese, 33.4 per
cent. fat; cheddar cheese, 36.8 per cent.; cream
cheese, 58.0 per cent.; full cream cheese averages
33.7 per cent.; old English cheese, 42.7 per cent.; etc.
Cream, on the other hand, contains less than we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>77</span>
suppose, being but 18.5 per cent. fat, and milk only
4.0 per cent. fat.</p>

<p>Our great source of fats, however—leaving out all
dairy products, which, it might be claimed, are indirectly
derived from the animal kingdom—is nuts.
The great value of these articles of food will become
apparent to us when we see that not only are they at
the head of the list in protein percentage and in fuel
value, but also in the percentage of their fats. Thus
we find almonds average 54.9 per cent. fat; beech-nuts,
edible portion, 57.4 per cent.; Brazil-nuts, edible
portion, 66.8 per cent. fat; butter-nuts, 61.2 per cent.
fat; cocoanuts, 50.6 per cent. fat; filberts, 65.3 per
cent.; hickory-nuts, 67.4 per cent.; peanuts, 38.6 per
cent.; pea-nut butter, 46.5 per cent.; pecans, 71.2 per
cent.; pine-nuts, 60.7 per cent.; California walnuts,
64.4 per cent.; black California walnuts, 53.3 per cent.;
soft-shell walnuts, 63.4 per cent. Chocolate also contains
48.7 per cent. fat. If now we compare with these
figures those “highly nutritious” invalid foods, meat
soups, etc., we find the fat percentages to run as
follows:—Beef soup, .4 per cent. fat; chicken, .8 per
cent.; clam chowder, .8 per cent.; and meat stew,
averaging 4.3 per cent. fat.</p>

<p>Let us now compare the relative percentages of
carbohydrates. In the majority of meats these are
so very low that it might almost be said they contain
no carbohydrates at all. In the above tables from
Atwater and Bryant’s analysis, it will be seen that no
figures at all appear in the column for carbohydrate
percentages. With the single exception of tripe, which
contains an average of .2 per cent., no mention is made
of a percentage of carbohydrates in any of the meats.
Hens’ eggs also contain practically none. Poultry
and game, when cooked, average from 2 per cent. to
5 per cent.; fish contain practically none, while shell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>78</span>fish
range from 1 per cent. to 3 per cent. This is all
the carbohydrates that the animal kingdom affords
us!</p>

<p>Turning now to dairy products, we find that various
cheeses furnish from 2 per cent. to 4 per cent. carbohydrates;
milk averages 5 per cent., but condensed,
unsweetened milk, or evaporated cream, average 11.2
per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that dairy
products, coming as they do, indirectly from the animal
kingdom, furnish a comparatively small percentage of
carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the vegetable kingdom, including
the grains, and see the relative percentage obtained
from them. Taking first the flours and the meals,
we find: barley, granulated, contains 79.8 per cent.
carbohydrates; buckwheat flour, 77.9 per cent.;
corn flour, 78.4 per cent.; corn meal, 75.4 per cent.;
oat meal, 67.5 per cent.; rolled oats, average 66.2
per cent.; rice, average 79 per cent.; flaked rice,
81.9 per cent.; entire wheat flour, 71.9 per cent.;
dried beans, 59.6 per cent.; beans, frijoles, 65.1 per
cent.; lima beans, 65.9 per cent.; dried peas, 62.0 per
cent.; cow peas, 60.8 per cent.; potatoes, 18.4 per
cent.; evaporated potatoes, 80.9 per cent.</p>

<p>Turning to fruits, we find that some of them contain
quite a large percentage of carbohydrates—from
10 per cent., in the case of blackberries, cranberries
and peaches, to 22 per cent. in the case of bananas.
Other fruits in their fresh condition range between
these. Certain nuts also contain a large percentage of
carbohydrates. Thus, almonds contain an average
of 17.3 per cent.; chestnuts, an average of 42.1 per
cent.; dried chestnuts, 74.2 per cent.; cocoanuts,
27.9 per cent.; Lichi-nuts, 77.5 per cent.; peanuts,
average, 24.4 per cent.; malted nuts, 43.9 per cent.
Chocolate also contains 30.3 per cent.; cocoa averages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>79</span>
37.7 per cent.; and yeast, 21 per cent. Again in
comparing with these figures our “nourishing invalid’s
food,” beef soups, etc., we find that meat stew contains
an average of 5.5 per cent. carbohydrates;
clam chowder, 6.7 per cent.; chicken soup, 2.4 per
cent.; beef soup, an average of 1.1 per cent.! It
is to be noticed in this connection that bean soup
contains a percentage of 9.4 per cent. carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Turning now to the column marked “ash” in the
various tables, we find that all meats contain an average
of about 1 per cent. Corn beef, pickled tongue, etc.,
cannot be fairly included in the list, because of the
mineral salts injected into the tissues of the animal.
But in all other cases 1 per cent. will be found a most
liberal allowance for this ash. It will be remembered
that our authors classified under the heading of
“mineral matters,” all phosphates, sulphates, chlorides,
salts of potassium, sodium, etc. These are very
essential articles of diet, though the part they play
in digestive processes is not yet fully understood.
They must be considered, however, valuable portions
of all food-stuffs; and, other things being equal, the
larger percentage of salts contained in organic compound
(not as separate mineral elements) the better.
Now, when we come to compare the articles of food
derived from the vegetable world, with animal products,
we find a very much larger percentage of all
mineral matters, in these foods. A few references
will make this clear. Rolled oats contain 2.1 per cent.;
rice flour, 8.8 per cent.; wheat flour, 4.8 per cent.;
dried beans, 3.5 per cent.; dried lentils, 5.7 per cent.;
evaporated potatoes, 3.1 per cent.; almonds, 2 per
cent.; beech-nuts, 3.5 per cent.; Brazil-nuts, 3.9 per
cent.; butter-nuts, 2.9 per cent.; chestnuts, 2.2 per
cent.; peanuts, 2 per cent.; pignolia nuts, 3.3 per
cent.; Sabine pine-nuts, 4.7 per cent.; pistachio-nuts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>80</span>
3.2 per cent. Most fruits contain a small percentage of
mineral matter, averaging perhaps, .5 per cent. Chocolate
contains 2.2 per cent. and cocoa, 7.2 per cent.
These percentages might, however, be vitiated by the
fact that foreign ingredients are used in the
preparation of these foods. Beef soups, etc., average from 1
per cent. to 2 per cent.</p>

<p>In thus giving the total percentage of ash contained
in any food, however, it must not be forgotten that
this is but a crude and imperfect method of arriving at
a just estimate of the value of that food, so far as its
ash percentage is concerned. Although the percentage
of mineral matters contained in the various foods is
very small, the part they play in the economy is exceedingly
important—altogether disproportionate to
the relatively small quantity of this matter. It is
well known that if we feed animals (or, for that matter,
human beings), upon certain foods, lacking in salts,
these individuals will ultimately die of “saline starvation”—no
matter how much food may have been eaten,
or how well proportioned the proteids, fats and carbohydrates.
This is an astonishing fact. These mineral
elements, contained in organic compound, must not
be confused, however, with the same elements in
<i>in</i>organic form—in which condition they are quite
unusable by the system. This is a question, however,
into which I do not desire to enter now. It is very
necessary, however, to point out and insist upon this
fact—that giving the total percentage of ash constitutents
or mineral matter, in any given article of
food, is of small value to us when attempting to balance
a diet, unless we know <i>in what</i> this percentage of mineral
matter consists. That is, 1.7 per cent. ash of a given
food may be composed of five different mineral elements
(in organic form) and the proportion of each would
vary largely. It is quite possible, therefore, for there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>81</span>
to be a larger percentage of any one mineral element
in a certain food, containing a lesser <i>total</i> ash percentage
than in one containing a greater ash percentage. That
is, supposing there to be two articles of diet, one containing
1.5 per cent. and the other 2 per cent. of ash. The
article of food containing the 1.5 per cent. of salts
might contain 1 per cent. of potash, while the article
containing 2 per cent. of total ash would contain but
5 per cent. of potash. It would be seen from this that
an article of food containing less total ash percentage
might contain relatively more of a certain element;
and if we wish to obtain and supply to the system
certain organic salts, it will only be necessary for us
to pick out those articles of diet which contain the
largest percentage of the required salt, and supply it
to the body, as food, for a longer or shorter period.
In this manner saline starvation, and the many ills
that result indirectly from it, may be avoided. It will
be evident from the above, therefore, that any tables,
giving the <i>total</i> ash percentage of the various foods
are practically valueless, so long as they do not carry
the analysis a step further, and tell us in what this
total percentage consists. Only in this manner can
any definite results be obtained; but it will be evident,
at all events, that any of the articles of diet containing
such organic salts would be preferable to meats, so
far as this aspect of the problem is concerned—since
meats contain practically none. It will be of interest
to consider, briefly, this question of the relative
proportion of each organic salt in the total ash
percentage.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to discover, only two
authors have paid particular attention to this question
of minute ash percentages: Dr H. Lahmann, in
Germany, and Mr Otto Carqué, in America. Both
of these authors have gone to considerable trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>82</span>
to obtain exact figures upon this question.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Let us
consider Dr Lahmann’s argument first: Taking milk
(of the human species) as the standard with which to
compare analyses of all foods—since it is to be supposed
that this would contain all organic salts as well as
proteid, fats and carbohydrates in exactly the right
proportion for the upbuilding of the healthy human
body—he found, by comparison, that the quantities
of soda and lime contained in our ordinary food are far
below the quantities necessary to maintain a healthy
existence, whereas the quantities of potash, iron and
phosphoric acid are generally too high. Although his
conclusions may not be accepted in full, it is evident
that some of them, at least, are correct; and one of the
most important conclusions to be drawn from his
argument is that, generally speaking, anæmia has
nothing to do with want of iron in the blood. It is
due to other causes—principally over-feeding, as I have
endeavoured to show in my “Vitality, Fasting and
Nutrition,” pp. 604-605.</p>

<p>Dr Lahmann shows us that we may replace any
quantity of meat or lentils, as well as bread and flour,
by fruits or green vegetables, and that the amount of
lime and other bone-forming salts will be increased
thereby. As a general thing it may be said that there</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>83</span></p>
<p>is a superabundance of potash in vegetable food. A
large number of diseases were found to be due to a
disproportion of the organic salts—this argument
running throughout Dr Lahmann’s book. The following
table will show clearly the percentage of the various
mineral salts in food-stuffs, and will prove conclusively
that certain salts, lacking in the human system, can
never be supplied by any amount of meat; and, further,
that a number of these salts cannot be supplied in
proper quantities by any other articles of food than
<i>fruits</i>. These, and these alone, contain many salts
in solution which the system needs. I shall, however,
consider this question at greater length when I come
to discuss the value of the fruitarian dietary. For the
moment, let us turn our attention to the tables of ash
percentages.</p>

<p>Now, if we compare the figures in the following tables,
we find that in practically every case the quantity of
any given food-salt is greater in all fruits, and practically
in every other article of diet than it is in meat. Taking
potassium, for example, we find that meat averages
(out of the total percentage of mineral matter) 41.30 per
cent., while blueberries average 57.1 per cent.; and
olives, 80.9 per cent. If we compare the quantity of
sodium, we find that meat contains 3.6 per cent.;
while apples contain 26.1 per cent.; strawberries,
28.5 per cent.; dried figs, 26.2 per cent. As some of
these, however, are percentages of smaller <i>total</i> ash
percentages, the disproportion is not so great as would
at first appear, though it is evident that the fruits
contain much more, even allowing for this. Making
the same reservations, we find that while meat contains,
of iron, an average of .7 per cent., strawberries contain
5.9 per cent.; gooseberries 4.56 per cent.; prunes,
2.5 per cent.; while spinach contains 3.35 per cent.;
asparagus, 3.4 per cent.; and lettuce, 5.2 per cent.</p>

<p>It is evident that, making all allowances for a smaller
total ash percentage, these articles of diet contain a far
greater percentage of iron than does meat, and the same
is true of practically all other salts, as can be seen by
referring to the tables. It is evident, therefore, that
other food-stuffs, and particularly fruits, will supply us
with more mineral matter than will the best of meats,
and are to be preferred in consequence.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary for us to compare the columns
headed “Refuse” and “Water,” since these are
practically the same in all food-stuffs, on the average,
and they do not effect, appreciably, the food-value
of any article of diet.</p>

<p>There remains only one valid objection to my argument,
and that is based upon the supposed fact that a
larger percentage of animal proteid is appropriated by
the system than is the case in vegetable foods. That is,
given a certain quantity of animal and vegetable foods,
both containing an equal amount of proteid, more will
be appropriated from the animal than from the vegetable
food-stuffs. A great many writers, such as Miss
Leppel, in England, have taken this ground. But I
would point out, first of all, that, even if it were true,
it would not invalidate the argument in the least, for
the reason that a far larger percentage of proteid is
contained in a smaller amount of non-flesh food, such as
nuts; and for that reason it would be easy enough to
supply the system with the same amount of proteid
from an equal, or even a lesser, bulk of food—even
granting the validity of the argument. But I dispute
the fact itself. Professor Russell H. Chittenden, of
Yale University, one of the most famous physiologists
in America, and director of the Sheffield Scientific
School, writes in his “Nutrition of Man” as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>87</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the digestion of proteid food-stuffs by the combined
action of gastric and pancreatic juice in the alimentary
tract, a large proportion of the proteid is
destined to undergo complete conversion into amino-acids;
and, from these fragments, the body, by a
process of synthesis, can construct its own peculiar
type of proteid. This latter suggestion is worthy of a
moment’s further consideration; as is well known,
every species of animal has its own peculiar type of
proteid, adapted to its particular needs. The proteids
of one species directly injected into the blood of another
species are incapable of serving as nutriment to the
body, and frequently act as poison.... The availability
or digestibility of food can be determined only by
physiological experiment. By making a comparison,
for a definite period of time, of the amount of the
different food ingredients, and the amount that passes
unchanged through the intestines, an estimate of its
digestibility can be made.... In a general way it may be
stated that with animal foods, such as meats, eggs, and
milk, about 97 per cent. of the contained proteid is
digested, and thereby rendered available to the body.
With ordinary vegetables, on the other hand, as they
are usually prepared for consumption, only about 85
per cent. of the proteid is made available. With a mixed
diet, with a variable admixture of animal and vegetable
foods, it is usually considered that about 92 per cent.
of the proteid contained therein will undergo digestion.”</p></div>

<p>At first sight, it would appear that this runs counter to
the argument that has been advanced; but we must
take into account the fact that Professor Chittenden is
here speaking only of vegetable proteid, and has made
no mention of <i>nuts</i>; and, as we have seen from the
tables, nuts contain a far larger percentage of
protein than meats. When we take into consideration
the small disproportion in the percentage assimilated,
and find that when meat is mixed with other articles
of food, as it invariably is, the percentage of its availability
is reduced to 92 per cent., while vegetable foods
are proportionately raised to the same figure, we see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>88</span>
that the apparent discrepancy practically vanishes to
nothing. And when we further take into account the
fact that an equal amount of proteid can be obtained
from a far <i>less</i> quantity of non-flesh food, we see that,
from an equal bulk of food material, a far larger <i>proportionate</i>
percentage would be assimilated from the
vegetable foods than from the animal.</p>

<p>Another great argument which has always been advanced
in favour of meat-eating, or the ingestion of
proteid in the form of animal, as opposed to vegetable
food, is that the proteid derived from the animal is far
more quickly and readily assimilated by the system
than vegetable proteid. The <i>rapidity</i> of the digestion
of animal food has always been urged as one of the
strongest arguments in its favour, and it is largely for
this reason that it has been administered to invalids,
and to patients in a depressed and weakened state of
body. But now we find that physiological research
has completely disproved this old dogma! Professor
Chittenden, on p. 30 of his “Nutrition and Man,” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is evident from what has been stated that the
gastric digestion of proteid foods <i>is a comparatively slow
process</i>, involving several hours of time; and further,
that food material in general remains in the stomach for
varying periods, dependent upon its chemical composition....
It is a mistake to assume that the digestion of
proteid foods is complete in the stomach. Stomach
digestion is to be considered more as a preliminary step,
paving the way for further changes to be carried forward
by the combined action of intestinal and pancreatic
juice in the small intestines.... The importance of
gastric digestion is frequently overrated.”</p></div>

<p>Dr Sylvester Graham, writing on this subject years ago
in his “Science of Human Life,” said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>89</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“In vain have they attempted to regulate the diet of
man on the chemical principles, and insisted on the
necessity for certain chemical properties in the human
element to sustain the vital economy. That economy
has shown them that it can triumph over the chemical
affinities and ordinary laws of organic matter, and bend
them to its purposes at pleasure; generating and transmuting
from one form to another, with the utmost ease,
the substance which human science calls elements;
and while the living organs retain their functional power
and integrity, elaborating from every kind of element on
which an animal can subsist, a chyle so nearly identical
in its physical and chemical character, that the most
accurate analytical chemists can scarcely detect the
least appreciable difference.... Though, while the health
and integrity of the assimilating organs are preserved,
the physical and <i>chemical</i> character of the chyle are
nearly identical, whatever may be the elementary substance
from which it was elaborated, yet the <i>vital</i> constitution
of the chyle and blood, and consequently of
the solids, is greatly affected by the quality of the food.
When chyle is taken from the living vessels, the vital constitution
of that which is elaborated from flesh meat is
capable of resisting the action of bacterial decomposition
only a short time, and will begin to putrefy in three or
four days at the longest; while the vital constitution of
that which is elaborated from pure and proper vegetable
elements, will resist this decomposing action for a much
larger period, yet it will in the end putrefy with all the
phenomena of that formed from flesh meat.”</p></div>

<p>The bearing of these facts on physical training, the
health of the body, and the decomposition of the body
after death, need only be pointed out.</p>

<p>It is really extraordinary how writers on dietetics,
seem to take a delight, as a rule, in making as many
mis-statements and misrepresentations as possible.
Take, for example, the following passage in Dr C. S.
Read’s Book, “Fads and Feeding”:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is necessary, with the vegetable products, to
take the nitrogenous product as Nature gives it to us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>90</span>
which is a drawback; and secondly, vegetable foods are
relatively much poorer in this respect than animal foods....
A vegetable diet must needs be bulky, because of
its wateriness, especially when cooked, and the large
amount of indigestible matter it contains. This tends
to abnormally distend the stomach and bowels. The
capacity of the stomach becomes greater, more food
can be taken, but the distention produces a feeling of
satiety before sufficient nourishment has really been ingested.
The dealing with such a bulk internally means
the expenditure of much nervous energy which might
have been better utilised. The wateriness of vegetable
foods is extremely disadvantageous, since on absorption
it tends to render all the tissues flabby. The individual
who leads a sedentary life will feel the disadvantage of
vegetarianism more than the active worker.”</p></div>

<p>Now, not a sentence in the above quotation is correct.
If Dr Read had studied vegetarians at first hand, he
would have found out his mistakes, and would not have
written such rubbish. As a matter of fact, vegetable
foods <i>do not</i> supply less nitrogen than meat, but on the
contrary more; a vegetable diet <i>need not</i> be bulky, if
properly selected—<i>less</i> of it need be eaten than of a
mixed diet, because of its greater nutritive value;
while the notion that the absorbtion of water from the
foods make the tissues “flabby” is, of course, absurd.
Altogether, this is almost the greatest string of inaccuracies
regarding diet that I have ever come across.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of this question which it might
be well to touch upon in this place. The air that we
breathe, as we know, contains a large percentage of
nitrogen. Might it not be possible for the system to
utilise some of this nitrogen, when the body is in a state
of nitrogen starvation? Dr De Lacy Evans, surgeon to
St Saviour’s Hospital, in London, contended that this
might be the case, and in his “How to Prolong Life,”
pp. 76-80, wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>91</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been argued that fruits will not sustain life,
because they do not contain sufficient nitrogen; this
argument is founded upon a <i>theory</i> which is demonstrably
incorrect, and it is an ascertained <i>fact</i> that fruits alone
will support life and good bodily health.... By experiments
on ourselves, on friends, and on natives of tropical
regions, we find a comparatively small quantity of
nitrogen necessary to sustain life; in fact, fruits, taken
as a class, contain sufficient nitrogen to sustain human
life.... Now fruits will sustain life, and all fruits contain
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and most of them a small
quantity of nitrogen; and if these fruits which will
sustain life do not contain sufficient nitrogen, may not
man, who breathes and is in contact with an atmosphere
(four-fifths of which is nitrogen), by means of his lungs,
the surface of which is supposed to be more than
twenty times that of the whole body, <i>absorb the necessary
nitrogen directly from the atmosphere</i>? From careful
observation of the diet of natives in tropical regions,
and from direct experiments in England, we may state
that this is positively the case. This is often observed
in the herbivora: their natural food contains little
nitrogen, still it is found in their flesh in about the same
ratio as in the carnivora. Further, the carnivora live
on food rich in nitrogen—yet one is as well nourished as
the other.... Man may live entirely upon fruits, in
better health than the majority of mankind now enjoy.
Good, sound, ripe fruits are never a cause of disease;
but the vegetable acids, as we have before stated, lower
the temperature of the body, decrease the process of
combustion and oxidation—therefore the waste of the
system—less sleep is required, activity is increased,
fatigue or thirst hardly experienced: still the body is
well nourished, and as a comparatively small quantity
of earthy salts are taken into the system, the cause of
‘old age’ is in some degree removed, the effect is delayed,
and life is prolonged to a period far beyond our
‘three score years and ten.’”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>92</span></p>
<p>The consensus of modern opinion, however, seems to
be against any such supposition. Chittenden, for
example, writes:<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Man lives in an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen.
He can and does absorb and utilise the free oxygen of
the air he breathes; indeed, it is absolutely essential
for his existence, but free nitrogen likewise drawn into
the lungs at each inspiration is of no avail for the needs
of the body.”</p></div>

<p>As, however, all bodies contain more or less nitrogen
in excess, there would be no need to call upon the air for
its supply. It would be interesting to note the effects
in cases of nitrogen starvation; but the simple fact
that animals <i>do die</i> when sufficient nitrogen is subtracted
from their food, would seem to indicate that but little
nitrogen, if any, can be extracted from the air, even
under these circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the above lengthy argument, which endeavours
to show that sufficient proteid can be supplied the body
from vegetable foods, it is somewhat amusing to find
that, as a matter of fact, <i>far too much proteid</i> has invariably
been eaten by practically all civilised peoples—and
that so far from there being any danger of nitrogen
starvation, or lack of sufficient proteid, the danger
is all the other way, and four-fifths of all the maladies
from which mankind suffers are due to the very fact
that an excess of proteid has been eaten! All physiologists
agree that the majority of people eat far more,
not only of proteid, but of all kinds of food, than is
required, according to their tables; and Professor
Chittenden has recently shown, as the result of an elaborate
series of experiments conducted at Yale, that the
average proteid standard set by physiologists, as being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>93</span>
necessary for the maintenance of health, is at least
<i>three times too high</i>! That is, the majority of persons
eat considerably more than three times too much proteid!
In view of these facts, it is amusing to find so
much fear exhibited on all hands in case the proteid
supply should not be sufficient in quantity.</p>

<p>These Yale nutrition investigations are now so widely
known that it would be useless to do more than refer to
them in this place. As the results of experiments upon
University professors, upon athletes, and upon a squad
chosen from the United States army, it was definitely
proved that the proteid standards were far too high:
the men flourishing, improving in every direction, and
even doing a <i>greater</i> amount of physical work than usual
on a diet averaging, in proteid value, about a third said
to be necessary by the physiologists. When we take
into account the fact that most people eat far more
proteid than the physiologists said was necessary, it
will be seen at once the tremendous disproportion which
exists between the amount actually consumed, and the
amount really needed by the body; and how absurd
it is, in face of these facts, to persist in demanding an
excess of those foods which contain such high proteid
percentages! Chittenden says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no question, in view of our results, that
people ordinarily consume much more food than there
is any real physiological necessity for, and it is more
than probable that this excess of food is in the long run
detrimental to health, weakening rather than strengthening
the body, and defeating the very objects aimed at....
One-half of the 118 grams of proteid food called for
daily, is quite sufficient to meet all the physiological
needs of the body, certainly under the ordinary conditions
of life; and with most individuals, especially
persons not living an active outdoor life, even a smaller
amount will suffice.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>94</span></p>
<p>The figures and calculations throughout his works,
however, show that the proteid intake may be reduced to
fully one-third of that said to be necessary in standard
physiologies, with nothing but increased health and
strength.</p>

<p>In summing up this question of the necessity of meat-eating,
one important fact must not be lost sight of,
which, in a sense, may be said to settle the argument in
favour of the vegetarian dietary without further additional
evidence of any kind. It is this: That the bodies
of all animals are built from vegetable foods, and consequently,
when we eat those animals, we merely eat the
vegetable foods, upon which <i>they</i> have subsisted, at
second hand! We appropriate or obtain the <i>same</i>
chemical elements in organic compound that they originally
obtained from their food, <i>but we obtain nothing else</i>.
Animals have the power to create nothing. The single
fact that all nutritive material is formed by vegetables—animals
having the power to appropriate but never to
form or create food elements—is proof positive, to my
mind, that we can derive all the nutriment we need
directly from the vegetable world, and that the best
food, and that which is most conducive to man’s highest
development—bodily, mentally and spiritually—is found
in the use of these vegetables themselves. Those who
eat animal food do not get a single element of nutrition,
save that which those animals have obtained from vegetables.
Hence man, in taking his nutrition indirectly,
by the eating of animals, must of necessity get the
original nutriment more or less deteriorated from the
unhealthy conditions and accidents of the animal he
feeds upon—with the impurities and putrescent matters
mingled with the blood and in the viscera of animal
substances, which are invariably present. Apart from
this aspect of the problem—which is one rather of
hygiene than of chemistry, and hence will be discussed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>95</span>
in the following chapter—it is evident that man can
derive no single element of nutrition from the bodies of
animals, which he cannot also obtain from suitable vegetable
foods. He need not eat grass and herbs, as do the
cows and sheep, in order to obtain this material—since
chemical analysis of the foods will readily show us that
these same elements are contained in fruits, nuts and
other substances suited to his economy. This argument
alone should, therefore, as a matter of fact, settle the
whole case in favour of vegetarianism as against flesh-eating,
without any further or additional proof being
necessary.</p>

<small>THE ARGUMENT FROM HYGIENE</small></h2></div>


<p>We have seen in the preceding pages that it is perfectly
possible for man to live upon vegetable and kindred
foods without necessitating the eating of animal foods
of any character—which merely confirms the evidence
afforded us by a study of comparative anatomy and
physiology. Having thus seen that it is <i>possible</i> for
man to live and thrive upon these foods, the question
at once arises: Can man thrive <i>best</i> upon such foods?
Can he maintain a <i>higher</i> level of vital and bodily
health, and of mental and moral powers, upon these
foods than he can upon the usual mixed diet of to-day—including
meat and its various products? If it can be
shown that this is the case—that a man cannot only
live, but improve in health and bodily strength on the
vegetarian régime—then it will be pretty obvious that
this is the diet best suited for man, and the diet upon
which he can thrive best. It would, in fact, confirm
the argument drawn from comparative anatomy, physiology,
and chemistry, and would conclusively prove
that man can live and thrive best upon a diet devoid of
flesh.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>97</span></p>
<p>In order to understand the evil effects of flesh-eating
thoroughly, it will be necessary for us, first of all, to
consider the normal body when living, and the process
of death. When the body of any animal is living, two
processes are simultaneously going on within it—viz.
the constructive and the destructive (Anabolism and
Catabolism). The former of these processes feeds and
bathes the tissues, while the latter is that process
whereby the dead matter is thrown off, and conveyed,
by means of the venous blood, to the various eliminating
organs. The arterial blood conveys the food material
to the bodily tissues; the venous blood conveys the
dead, worn-out, effete material from the various tissues
to the eliminating organs. If either of these two processes
ceases, or is in any way interfered with, grave
results follow—which, if persisted in long enough,
will result in the death of the organism. It must be
remembered that all the poisons which are thrown off
by the cells, throughout the body, are not really
eliminated until they have been conveyed to the
depurating organs, and been completely dissipated in
that way. If they are still in the venous blood or in
the tissues, they are still <i>in the animal</i>, and a part of
its flesh. These waste substances are poisonous, and
are produced very rapidly by an animal in movement,
or even by the very process of living, so that every
animal, no matter how healthy, must and does contain
a vast amount of these poisons, the accumulation of
which would soon kill the animal if not removed—as
has often been proved by varnishing the surface of the
body, <i>e.g.</i> When the action of the skin is stopped in
this manner the animal soon dies. Again, when a man
is strangled, and the blood forced to pass through
the lungs several times without being oxidised and
purified by contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere,
the blood soon becomes almost <i>black</i> in appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>98</span>
(due to retained poisons), and the man dies as the result
of the rapid formation of poisons within his system.
These facts must be borne in mind, in what follows.
This constant formation of deadly poisons, as the mere
result of living, is a most important factor in the
problem, as we shall soon see; and is one that cannot
be overlooked when considering this question of the
propriety and wisdom of flesh-eating.</p>

<p>Having grasped the above facts, let us now proceed
to apply them to the problem before us. When an
animal is killed in any manner whatever, it does not
instantly die. It loses consciousness, its heart ceases
to beat, its conscious and somatic life end, but its
<i>tissues</i> still continue to live—for several hours, in the
case of warm-blooded animals, for several days in the
case of cold-blooded animals, like the snake and the
turtle. During the time which elapses between death,
so-called, and the actual death of the cells and tissues
of the body, the activity of the animal tissues consumes
the soluble food material which is in contact with
these cells and tissues—at the same time continuing to
produce those waste substances, which, during life, are
rapidly removed from the body through the kidneys,
lungs, and other excretory organs.</p>

<p>It is by the accumulation of these poisons after death
that the tissues are killed. During life, the tissues
are washed by a pure stream of blood, which not only
bathes but feeds them, and at the same time gathers
up the waste substances and carries them to the liver
for distribution to the kidneys, lungs and skin, for
elimination. “When the heart ceases to beat, this
cleansing process ceases, and the poisons which are
ever forming, accumulate at a rapid rate until the vital
fluids are so saturated that every living structure is
killed. The arteries continue to contract after death
until all the blood which they contain is forced on into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>99</span>
the tissues, and still farther on into the veins, so that
the flesh of a dead animal contains nothing but venous
blood and poisonous juices, in addition to the organised
tissues which have not yet been broken down.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, it will be apparent why it is
that meat-eating is so destructive. In addition to the
useful and necessary nitrogenous products that are
contained within the flesh of the animal, there are also,
contained within its tissues, these poisons created
during life, and retained within the body of the animal
after its death. It is almost impossible to extract
these poisons by any process which will also leave
the tissues of the animal free from them, and wholesome
in consequence. By long continued washing, it is
possible to extract the greater proportion of them;
but this is never done, as a matter of fact, and even
if it were it would leave behind a tough, elastic substance,
almost tasteless, which would be quite unappetising
to the person attempting to eat the meat.
It would no longer have any charms! This, then, is the
greatest objection that can be raised against meat-eating
(from this particular aspect)—viz. that, in addition
to the nutritious portion of the meat, there are and must
always remain, and go along with it, these poisons
which are consequently eaten with it. Now, I ask,
would it not be better to eat that food which provides
us with the useful material (proteid) for the upbuilding
of the body; but food in which these poisons are not
present, and which we consequently escape? Such
being the case, why not eat only those foods which
supply the nutriment, without the poisons?</p>

<p>I have observed above that certain poisons are invariably
retained in the tissues of an animal which has
died; and that these poisons may be, to a certain extent,
washed out by water—they, of course, remaining in the
water into which they have been washed. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>100</span>
case with “beef tea”—the boiling having the effect of
washing out all these poisons, and dissolving them in
the water in which the meat has been cooked. Instead
of throwing away this water, however, it is carefully
preserved, and given to patients, as valuable and
precious nutriment! Instead of regarding it as so much
poison and filthy excreta in solution, it is given to
patients as a restorative tonic! It is really amazing
that patients ever get well at all under such treatment.
It is certain that none of the real goodness of the meat
can be extracted by any process of boiling or washing,
for the reason (1) that all the arterial blood has been
converted into venous blood soon after the death of the
animal; and (2) because animal tissue is <i>per se</i> indissoluble
in water. Were this not so—if our tissues dissolved
in water in this manner—then we should melt
and dissolve like a lump of sugar whenever we went
out in the rain, or when we happened to fall into the
water; but we know that such is not the case. It is
obvious, therefore, that only the excrementitious
products can be washed away in this manner; and
these are the parts of the tissue which are soaked and
boiled into the water. In beef tea, therefore, we obtain;
only the refuse and poisonous excreta of an animal—and
very little, if any, of its real nutritive qualities.</p>

<p>But it may be contended that beef tea <i>does</i> benefit
sick persons: they really do feel better after taking it!
Quite possibly; but this feeling of elation is due to
<i>stimulation</i>. If the public understood what stimulation
really is, they would not urge any sick patient to eat
or drink anything that in any way stimulated him; but
would on the contrary forbid him to eat or drink anything
which affected him in this way! If they understood
the <i>rationale</i> of stimulation, they would never
urge or suggest that any stimulating food be administered
to the patient again. For how do stimu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>101</span>lants
stimulate? What is the <i>rationale</i> of their
“action”?</p>

<p>When we see a horse plodding slowly along the street,
and the driver suddenly cuts it across the back with
his whip, the horse jumps, and reaches the end of the
street more quickly than if he had not been so whipped.
In such a case, does anyone suppose that any strength
has been <i>imparted</i> or <i>given to</i> the horse; or is it not
rather that the energy already present in the horse
has been forced, and expended a little more quickly?
Of course, the latter. In other words, the energy has
been extracted <i>from</i> the horse, and not imparted <i>to</i> it.
It is the same with all stimulants whatever. In every
case, their action is the same. It is not that energy
has been imparted to the organism, but rather that it
has been abstracted from it—in the process of resisting
and expelling the stimulant. Stimulation does not
impart strength; it wastes it. Vital power does not
go out of the brandy into the patient, but occasions
vital power to be exhausted from the patient in expelling
the brandy. The system expends its force to get rid
of the alcohol, but never derives any force, great or
small, good, bad or indifferent, <i>from</i> the alcohol. Stimulants
merely occasion the expenditure of strength and
energy; they do not impart either <i>to</i> the system.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>From the above facts, it will readily be seen why it is
that beef tea is a stimulant of the highest order; and
for that reason an apparent supporter of strength. In
fact, it is now becoming to be realised in many quarters
that beef tea is more of a stimulant than a food; and,
if you believe in the one, you cannot accept the other.
These facts will also enable us to understand the
stimulating character of meat—a quality which has
gained for it the reputation of being “strengthening,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>102</span>
and consequently “good food” for the weak invalid!
But it so happens, unfortunately, that <i>because</i> of this
very fact it is really disqualified as a food for the invalid;
and this would be seen clearly enough if the true
<i>rationale</i> of stimulation were properly understood.
The fact of the matter is that the more stimulating
a food, the less nutritious, and <i>vice versa</i>. Perhaps I
cannot do better than quote Dr Trall in this connection.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Medical men teach us that animal food is more
stimulating. Here, for once, the premise is true. But
stimulation and nutrition happen to be antagonistic
ideas. Just so far as a thing stimulates, it does not
nourish. Just so far as it nourishes, it does not stimulate.</p>

<p>“There is no more widespread delusion on earth than
this, which confounds stimulation and nutrition. This
is the parent source of that awful error—or, rather
multitude of errors—which are leading all the nations of
the earth into all manner of riotous living, and urging
them on in the road to swift destruction. This terrible
mistake is the prime cause of all the gluttony, all the
drunkenness, all the dissipation, all the debauchery in
the world—I had almost said, of all the vice and crime
also.</p>

<p>“But what is this stimulus of animal food? Let us
see if we cannot understand it. What is a stimulant? It
is anything which the vital powers resist with violence
and expel with energy. The disturbance of the organism
which denotes this resistance, constituting a kind of
feverishness, is stimulation. It is a morbid process.
It is disease, hence a wasting process. Medical books
have a class of medicines which are called stimulants.
They are all poisons, and not foods. Among them are
alcohol, phosphorus, ammonia, cayenne pepper, etc.
Anything which is foreign to the organism may provoke
vital resistance, and in this sense be called a stimulant.</p>

<p>“But how does animal food stimulate? It always
contains more or less effete materials—the debris of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>103</span>
disintegrated tissues, the ashes of the decayed organism—with
more or less of other excrementitious matters.
These impurities cannot be used in the organism, and
therefore must be expelled; and this expulsive process,
amounting to a feverish disturbance, this vital resistance,
is precisely the <i>rationale</i> of the stimulating effects of
animal food. And thus we prove that animal food is
impure precisely in the ratio that it is stimulating, and
for this reason objectionable.</p>

<p>“All that can be alleged in favour of flesh-eating
because of its stimulating properties can be urged, and
for precisely the same reasons, in favour of brandy-drinking
or arsenic-eating.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>There is nothing more certain than that the eating of
meat, even if the meat be clean and wholesome, and the
eating of it be not excessive, will in time produce grave
results and diseases of the foulest and worst type. Not
invariably, of course, but almost invariably. The rapid
increase in uric acid which results from a flesh diet has
previously been pointed out, and is now well known.
In addition to this, there are numerous other poisons
that are formed, or introduced into the body, as the result
of flesh-eating—as Bouchard and others have proved
conclusively. These poisons and their effects were
carefully studied by Bouchard, and the results of his
experiments are very interesting and convincing. He
succeeded in isolating a number of poisons from the urea
of flesh-eaters, and injecting them into animals, and
noted the results. “One of the poisons in most minute
doses produces death with violent spasms; another
causes rapid fall of temperature until death occurs;
another influences animal temperature in another direction;
still another produces death with most profound
coma.”</p>

<p>The basis of the demonstration is this. The urine
is really an extract from the tissues; the kidneys do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>104</span>
manufacture poisons <i>de novo</i>, but simply separate from
the blood poisons found in solution therein, which have
been washed by the blood-current from the tissues
which it bathes in passing through the capillary network
of systemic circulation. Bearing these facts in
mind, Bouchard and his assistants injected into live
rabbits certain known quantities of these poisons, and
noted the results. Death invariably resulted—frequently
in a very short time, and as the result of taking
an extremely small dose of the poison. It was also
found that, by increasing the amount of meat in the
diet, the amount of these toxins could be increased accordingly,
and proportionately; the greater the amount
of meat consumed, the greater the amount of toxin
given off by the animal in its urine, and the more deadly
its effects. It was even found that a person living almost
exclusively upon a flesh diet increased these toxins
to fourfold the normal limit!</p>

<p>Again, it is now well known that in all infectious and
contagious diseases there are created within the system
certain poisons which play a large part in the disease—they
are a factor of immense importance. This being
the case, it becomes obvious how important it is to keep
out of the system all other and unnecessary poisons—such
as might be introduced into the system by foul
air, bad water, food containing poisons, etc. Since
meat and beef tea contain these poisons in excess, it is
certain that they should not only form <i>no</i> part of the
diet of invalids, but should be strictly <i>forbidden</i>, just
as any other poison is.</p>

<p>Metchnikoff has recently pointed out, with great
emphasis, the immense influence upon health of intestinal
putrefaction. He insists that it shortens life; is one
of the chief causes of premature old age and death, and
is the cause of many diseases and much misery during
life—in all of which he is doubtless quite right. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>105</span>
method of checking this intestinal putrefaction, however,
does not appeal to me as other than a palliative measure.
Lactic acid is, for him, the great preventive of putrefaction
of this type; but is it not obvious that such a
treatment is merely one that aims at <i>results</i>, rather than
at <i>causes</i>? one which attempts to patch up existing conditions,
instead of trying to find out what gave rise to
those conditions, and checking <i>them</i>? M. Metchnikoff
has apparently failed to realise the fact that there is no
need whatever for the human intestine being in any
such diseased and disgusting condition as it is generally;
that, in certain cases, it may be rendered absolutely
sweet and clean—with virtually no putrefaction going on
in the bowel at all. In the case of Mr Horace Fletcher,
for instance (and in many of his disciples), no such conditions
are present or possible. Mr Fletcher, writing
in his “New Glutton or Epicure,” says (pp. 144-145):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the most noticeable and significant results of
economic nutrition, gained through careful attention to
the mouth treatment of food, or buccal-digestion, is not
only the small quantity of waste obtained but its inoffensiveness.
Under best test conditions the ashes of
economic digestion have been reduced to one-tenth of
the average given as normal in the best text-books on
physiology. The economic digestion ash forms in pillular
shape, and, when released, these are massed together,
having become so bunched by considerable retention in
the rectum. There is no stench, no evidence of putrid
bacterial decomposition, only the odour of warmth, like
warm earth or ‘hot biscuit.’ Test samples of excreta,
kept for more than five years, remain inoffensive, dry up,
gradually disintegrate, and are lost.”</p></div>

<p>To my mind, it has always been so obvious that, if we
supplied no food to decompose, there could be no decomposition,
that I hardly thought the question was
open to debate at all. It would appear to me to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>106</span>
axiomatic that if we only supplied the body with as much
food as it really needed, and of the proper quality,
there would be virtually no food left to decompose, or to
offer pabulum for germs of any character whatever.
Certainly this is the case outside the human intestine,
and why not in it? One can quite easily see why it
should be—why putrefaction should take place, if the
amount of food ingested were excessive in quantity, or
poisonous in quality; <i>but not otherwise</i>. The former of
these two questions I have discussed at length in my
former volume on fasting; the latter aspect of the
problem is the one I propose to discuss in this book.</p>

<p>If we compare the decomposition of various articles
of food, we find there is a very great difference (both as to
the quality and the quantity) in the various food-stuffs.
Under the same conditions, and during the same period
of time, the extent of the decomposition, and its character,
will be very different, in the two cases. Compare
the decomposition of a pear, a peach or a plum, <i>e.g.</i>,
with that of a piece of beef or mutton! Animal tissues
and products, when undergoing the process of decay
or decomposition are particularly offensive; and this
fact is well borne out by a comparative study of the
excreta of the various animals. As before pointed out,
that of the herbivora and frugivora is comparatively
inoffensive, while that of the carnivora is very offensive,
and dangerous also. This is particularly the case with
man, when he eats meat of any character. His fæces
at once assume a characteristic odour and character;
and clearly indicate that he has wandered away from
his natural diet, and is living upon food altogether
foreign and unnatural to him. His tissues also take on
the chemical composition of the resulting mass—being
coloured and influenced by it. Meat and all animal
products easily decomposing, and being in a moist,
warm place, where they might easily decompose at once,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>107</span>
they assume a most offensive character; and it does not
require much imagination to see that the results would
be disastrous in a very short time, under such circumstances;
and clearly indicate that the individual is
living on food unsuited to his needs and his organism.</p>

<p>Even when an animal is perfectly healthy, its tissues
begin to decompose as soon as the animal is really dead—as
soon as <i>rigor mortis</i> has passed away. Even when
meat is kept at a very low temperature, it has been
found that it decomposes after the first twenty-four
hours; so that the amount of decomposition present in
all animals whose carcasses have been hanging up for
hours, and even days, in a shop may easily be imagined!
In the case of game, the carcasses are frequently green
and blue with decomposition, and the chemicals injected
into the animal in order to preserve it from such
decomposition. For only in this manner can meats be
preserved; and it has been proved time and time again
that meats are treated and “doctored” with drugs and
chemicals of all kinds in order to delay their decomposition.
To think that we really eat such stuff, and
give it to our children, and even <i>prescribe</i> it for invalids,
is too revolting for words! It passes all comprehension!
Dr Kellogg, in his excellent little book on this subject,
says, when speaking of the deadly effects of the poisons
formed within the body:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Physiologists sometimes, for experimental purposes,
separate from its bony attachments one of the muscles
of a frog’s leg, and arrange it in such a manner, in connection
with a battery and a suitable device, that by a
repetition of electric shocks the muscle may be made to
contract and lift a small weight. After being thus made
to work for a longer or shorter period, the muscle becomes
fatigued to such a degree that it no longer contracts
in response to the electric stimulus. This is
shown to be due to the accumulation of the waste
matters, of which mention has been made. If at this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>108</span>
point the muscle is washed with a weak saline solution, it
at once recovers its ability to work. If now a <i>fresh</i>
muscle is thus prepared, and strong beef tea or solution
of beef extract applied to it, the muscle at once becomes
expanded or unable to contract, the same as if it had
been working for a long time, but without having done
any work whatever! The reason for this is that the
beef tea or beef extract is simply a solution of the same
poisons which are developed in the muscles by work,
and to the paralysing effect of which its fatigue and inability
to contract are due.... By injection of the fluid
obtained by compressing a piece of beef steak or so-called
beef juice into the veins of a rabbit, it has been
proved to be highly deadly in character. The quantity
of beef juice required to kill a rabbit of given weight is
<i>less</i> than the amount of urine required to produce the
same effect.... The juice obtained from the flesh of a
dog was twice as poisonous as that obtained from ox
flesh; in other words, it required twice as much beef
juice to kill an animal of given weight as the juice obtained
from the flesh of a dog....”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>Upon this subject of beef tea, Dr Tibbles says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Beef tea, mutton broth, chicken broth, and other
meat infusions are useful for sick persons, for they are
stimulating and restoring, but they are recognised now
chiefly as stimulants to tissue change or to metabolism
rather than as foods proper. They do not prevent wasting
of the body; indeed, when given alone, <i>they cause
more rapid wasting than no food at all. Dogs fed on beef
tea die sooner than when they are not fed at all.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>In the U. S. Dept. of Agr. Bulletin, No. 102, “Experiments
on Losses in Cooking Meat,” we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Beef which has been used for the preparation of
beef tea or broth has lost comparatively little nutritive
value, though much of the flavouring material has been
removed” (p. 64).</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>109</span></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that beef tea extracts practically
nothing from the meat; and that the bulk of the nutriment,
such as it is, remains in the meat. This, however,
is invariably thrown away! We thus see that neither
the beef tea nor the remaining mass of meat is of any
use; while both are certainly harmful. So much for
beef tea!</p>

<p>It is now a well-known fact that meat-eating is the
more or less direct cause of various diseases. Tapeworm
is one of these, most easily and directly traceable
to meat; and a very serious disease it can become.
Beef and pork are two great carriers of the cysts, or
tapeworm embryos; and they develop in the intestine,
whence it is most difficult to extract them. Fish is
another great cause of tapeworm; and no matter how
fresh these meats may be, this same danger is run, and
can never be completely guarded against. These facts
are now so well known that it is unnecessary to quote
authority in support of them. The deadly trichina,
found mainly in pork, but also in fish, fowls, and in other
meats, is the direct cause of trichinosis—a disease so
closely resembling cerebro-spinal meningitis that it is
impossible to distinguish between the two at first,
and without a detailed diagnosis. The history of the
infection is said to be somewhat as follows:—rats
visit a cemetery, and become infected with trichinæ.
After a time, the rat dies of infection. The hog—the
universal scavenger—eats it. Man—the greatest of
all scavengers—eats the hog, and thus becomes infected
in turn! It is not a very pleasant thought, or
one calculated to elevate man to a position “a little
lower than the angels!”</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is another disease that is very frequently
communicated to the human organism from
the carcasses of dead cattle. In his “Human and
Bovine Tuberculosis,” Dr E. F. Brush contends most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>110</span>
strenuously that phthisis is very frequently contracted
in this manner, and advances strong evidence in support
of his claim. He says (pp. 9-10):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The total number of cows in the United States
for the year 1887 was 14,522,083—that is, one cow to
every four and three-fourths (4.7) persons. There
exists, according to Lynt, a true parallel between
human and bovine phthisis; the curves of double
mortality are the same for different districts in the
Duchy of Baden. Now this must mean that a larger
proportion of the bovine race dies from phthisis than
of the human race, because of the difference in the
length of life between the races. We have no statistics
of this kind in the United States, but Professor R. A.
McLean tells me that, where cows are affected by tuberculosis
in great numbers, the death rate from phthisis
is correspondingly large in the human race in the same
districts. This is his observation from his large experience
among diseased cattle.”</p></div>

<p>It would be useless for me to enumerate in full all
the numerous diseases that are traceable to meat-eating.
That alone would occupy an extensive volume.
Typhoid fever has frequently been traced to the eating
of oysters. A disease closely related to hog-cholera
has been known to be contracted by the human being,
as the result of eating pork. Meat-eating is known
to be one of the chief and most direct causes of the decay
of the teeth—the small fibres of the meat becoming
wedged in between them, and, decomposing, cause
rapid decay of the teeth. It is probable that this is
one of the chief causes of the bad teeth we see about us.
Gout and rheumatism are now well known to result
from the eating of meat. The reasons for this might
perhaps be given. As the result of excessive meat-eating,
and eating <i>too much</i> food, the body becomes
choked with an excess of mal-assimilated food material,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>111</span>
and particularly with uric acid—a product of the meat.
The blood, being surfeited with this material, deposits
some of it in the vicinity of the joints, and this gives
rise to the various symptoms of gout. It is beginning
to be realised that this disease, formerly thought to be
the direct result of the drinking of wine and other
alcoholic beverages, is due to “good old English beef.”
Rheumatism is largely due to the same cause. Meat
poisoning shows itself in various forms; but the cause
is the same. It is now known that meat-eating is the
chief cause of Brights disease; and to all unprejudiced
minds, it will be obvious that this <i>must</i> be so. The
excess of albumen in the system cannot well be due to
any other cause: and the mode of cure thus becomes
apparent also.</p>

<p>It is certain, to anyone who has studied the facts
carefully, that meat-eating predisposes the body to all
forms of disease. In pestilences of any character—statistics,
so far as they have been kept, conclusively
show that the vegetarians escaped the disease, and that
the meat-eaters were the chief sufferers. The excess
of poisons introduced into the system predispose it
to any form of disease to which it may be exposed
at the time; the general tone of the system being
lowered, owing to the lessened resistance, it becomes
a ready prey to any contagious disease which might be
prevalent at the time. In further support of this, it has
long been known that wounds heal far more rapidly
in vegetarian soldiers and in all others who live upon
foods of this character, than in those who live largely
upon meat. Carnivorous animals are far more subject
to blood poisoning than are vegetarian animals. These
latter may be very badly wounded, and escape with a
scar; but lions and tigers and other carnivorous
animals frequently die from blood poisoning, though
but slightly wounded. There can be no reason for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>112</span>
this, beyond that indicated above. The tissues of the
animal’s body are more or less saturated with poison,
in the first place; and it required but a small amount
in addition, to turn the scale against the animal, and
cause its death. It is surely the same, to a great extent,
in the case of human beings.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is another disease which has been more or
less directly traced to meat-eating. A few years ago,
Dr Warner, of the Eastern Illinois Insane Asylum,
called attention to the profound influence of flesh
dietary upon epileptics. He found that it had a most
pernicious influence. By experiment he also ascertained
that cats fed upon meat, or allowed to eat the
mice they caught, frequently become epileptic.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained, further, that a strictly
vegetarian diet is the best possible preparation that
can be made for a surgical operation of any kind; and
that vegetarians die less frequently, as the result of
severe operations, than do meat-eaters. Paget, in
his “Lessons on Clinical Surgery,” states that there is a
higher death rate from operations in cities than in rural
districts; and he considers that this is largely due to
the greater amount of meat consumed in the cities.</p>

<p>Of late years much attention has been devoted to
the relations of cancer and meat-eating. Several
authors have called attention to this fact; Dr Alexander
Haig, in his “Uric Acid in the Causation of Disease,”
strongly contends that the consumption of flesh is one
of the chief causes of cancer, and points out that any
irritant to the tissues will invariably be one of the
chief factors in the causation of this disease. As he
showed that meat-eating created much uric acid in
the system, and that this uric acid acts as an irritant
upon the tissues, it is obvious that the consumption
of flesh-foods is one of the chief causes of this dreaded
disease. Lately, the Hon. Rollo Russell, in his book,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>113</span>
“The Reduction of Cancer,” has defended this view
very strongly, and has gathered together a great deal
of evidence bearing upon this problem—showing that
there is a definite connection between the amount
of flesh consumed and the number of cases of cancer,
in any one locality. He has also advanced strong
reasons for supposing that the one is directly <i>caused</i>
by the other. As a result of comparing the food
habits and the mortality tables of a large number of
countries and districts, it was found to be the invariable
rule that when, in any locality, meat-eating was excessive,
the cancer rate was high; and where meat-eating
was small, it fell to a comparatively low figure.
A number of other authorities could be quoted in this
connection. Thus Dr Lambe remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The effects of animal food, and other noxious
matter, in inducing and accelerating fatal disease, are
not immediate, but ultimate effects. The immediate
effect is to engender a diseased habit or state of constitution;
not enough to impede the ordinary occupations
of life, but, in many, to render life itself a long-continued
sickness; and to make the great mass of
society morbidly susceptible to many passing impressions
which would have no injurious influence on
healthy systems.”</p></div>

<p>Drs Clarke, Buchan, Abernethy, Sir Edward Berry,
Drs Sigmond, Copland, Alphonus Lercy, Graham,
Wardell, Trall, and many other of the older writers
were of the same opinion; and a number of recent
authorities have taken the same stand. It is beginning
to be realised that meat-eating is one of the most potent
of all the causes of deadly and fatal diseases of many
kinds—all more or less directly traceable to it. But,
in addition to these varied diseases, there are induced
states of the body which must rightly be looked upon
as diseased—though they are not actual diseases, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>114</span>
the sense generally understood by that term. Meat-eating
is, however, one of the most potent of all factors
in inducing that state of the body known as “predisposition”
to disease—and in deadening and lowering
the vitality, and in enfeebling the senses. I shall
now proceed to adduce evidence in support of these
various statements, and show that the effects of meat-eating
are far more insidious and widespread than is
generally believed; and that the effects of this practice,
even among the supposedly healthy, are indeed baneful
and disease-engendering.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be pointed out and insisted
upon that meat is a highly <i>stimulating</i> article of food,
and for that reason, innutritious. Stimulation and
nutrition invariably exist in inverse ratio—the more
the one the less the other, and <i>vice versa</i>. The very
fact, then, that meat is a stimulant, as it is now universally
conceded to be, shows us that it is more or less
an innutritious article of diet, and that the supposed
“strength” we receive from the meat is due entirely
to the stimulating effects upon the system of the various
poisons, or toxic substances, introduced into the
system, together with the meat. It is for this reason
that those who leave off meat, and become vegetarians,
experience a feeling of lassitude and weakness, for the
first few days—they lack the stimulation formerly
supplied, and now notice the reaction which invariably
follows such stimulation. This feeling of weakness, or
“all-goneness,” is therefore to be expected, and is in
no wise a proof that the diet is weakening the patient.
Let him persist in his reformed manner of living for
some time, and he will find that this reaction wears off,
and that a general and continued feeling of energy and
well-being follow.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that only by eating large
quantities of animal foods can the bodily heat be main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>115</span>tained
in cold climates. Such is by no means the case.
Although the Esquimaux, and the inhabitants of
Greenland and Iceland, do subsist almost entirely upon
fats and animal substances, many of the peasants of
Northern Russia and other parts of the globe, eat
very little meat—for the reason that they cannot secure
it. Dr Graham, in his “Lectures,” went so far as to
say that: “All other things being precisely equal,
the man who is fully accustomed to a pure vegetable
diet, can endure severer cold, or bear the same degree
of cold much longer than the man who is fully accustomed
to a flesh diet.” The truth probably is, as Dr
Trall pointed out, that, “the ordinary farinaceous
foods and fruits contain all the carbon and hydrogen
requisite to sustain the animal heat in all climates,
and under all circumstances of temperature; and if
ever surplus carbon or hydrogen is taken into the
system, it is, of course, thrown off; and when a large
amount of surplus carbon and hydrogen is taken, the
labour of expelling it is attended with a feverish excitement—which,
instead of warming the body permanently,
only wastes its energies, and renders it
colder in the end.” The body is, in other words,
continually in a more or less feverish condition.</p>

<p>In discussing this question in my “Vitality, Fasting
and Nutrition” (Book III., ch. 4, “Bodily Heat”) I
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There can be no doubt that the oxidation of the
tissues throughout the system, and the combination of
the oxygen with the carbon are sources of animal heat,
in common with all the organic functions and chemical
changes which take place in the body. All the conditions
requisite for the due regulation of the animal
temperature are: good digestion, free respiration,
vigorous circulation, proper assimilation, and perfect
depuration; in two words—<i>good health</i>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>116</span></p>

<p>It is thought by many that “stamina” can only be
maintained upon a diet derived largely from flesh,
but this is not at all the case. In the chapter on the
experience of nations and individuals, I shall adduce a
considerable quantity of evidence tending to show
that a <i>greater</i> amount of endurance can be secured upon
a vegetarian than upon a mixed diet! But many persons
do not mean by the word “stamina,” endurance
alone. It is often difficult to get a definition of this
word, as it varies with individual conceptions. If,
however, by “stamina,” is meant stoutness of person,
and fullness of blood, such “stamina” constitutes
the very food of disease, and the person in such a state
is not only more liable to febrile and epidemic attacks,
but is also in much greater danger while labouring
under them, than one whose development is such as to
allow all the secretary functions to be performed with
ease, and whose blood is not so charged with either
natural or extraneous elements. How frequently
do we hear of those who are said to be looking well and
healthy being suddenly cut off by apoplexy, or some
malignant disorder! The fact is, we are deceived by
appearances, by what we erroneously consider the
indications of health; for those whom we are taught
to regard as healthy and robust are generally the
farthest from safety, and only need a slight exciting
cause to bring on a fatal disease. It is not the apparent
disease which is the real cause of death, but men die
because the body is worn out; the tone of the fibres
is destroyed, and the principle of motion fails. The
obvious disease is the mask under which the condition
is concealed.</p>

<p>I have referred before to the protection against
epidemics afforded by a strictly hygienic life, and particularly
by the vegetarian diet. There is an abundance
of testimony on this point to which it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>117</span>
more than refer. Bush, in his “Works,” vol. iv., p. 55,
observed that the negroes of the West India Islands,
were at that time almost wholly exempt from yellow
fever, which cut off the resident upper classes in large
numbers. Mr Hardy, a noted Scotch philanthropist,
escaped the yellow fever in New York, he asserts, by
his course of living; while Mr Whitlaw, of New Orleans,
Dr Rush, of Philadelphia, and Dr Copeland, also assert
that they escaped yellow fever by abstinence. The poet
Shelley, in his “Vindication of Natural Diet,” p. 18, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no disease, bodily or mental, which adoption
of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly
mitigated, wherever the experiment has been fairly
tried. Debility is gradually converted into strength,
disease into healthfulness; madness, in all its hideous
variety, from the ravings of the fettered maniac, to the
uncontrollable irrationalities of ill-temper, that makes
a hell of domestic life, into a calm and considerable
evenness of temper—that alone might offer a certain
pledge of the future moral reformation of Society. On
a natural system of diet, old age would be our last and
our only malady: the term of our existence would be
protracted; we should enjoy life, and no longer preclude
others from enjoyment of it. All sensational
delights would be infinitely exquisite and perfect;
the very sense of being would then be a continued pleasure,
such as we now feel in some few and favoured
moments of our youth. By all that is sacred in our
hopes for the human race I conjure those who love
happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable
system. Reasoning is surely superfluous on a subject
whose merits and experience of six months would set
for ever at rest. But it is only among the enlightened
and benevolent that so great a sacrifice of appetite and
prejudice can be expected—even though its ultimate
excellence would not admit of dispute.”</p></div>

<p>Another argument in favour of the vegetarian dietary,
as against meat-eating, is found in the fact that such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>118</span>
diet is conducive to symmetry and normal development
of the human frame. We shall see (p. 142) how the
abdomens of the pigmies were greatly reduced, as a
result of abandoning their exclusive flesh diet. Many
men are said to have reduced their weight from ten to
one hundred and fifty pounds by an abstemious, non-flesh
diet. The body also assumes a more symmetrical
form, and the skin and complexion a ruddier and more
healthful glow. It must be admitted, however, that the
flesh of meat is not, of itself, a fat-forming food; and
many persons are put upon a diet of minced beef and
hot water, in order to reduce their weight. This they do,
generally, however, at the expense of the general bodily
health. In the Banting cure, and the various cures
which are followed in America and in England, the
weight is reduced, but with doubtful benefit to the
patient. The large amount of beef creates an excess
of acid within the system, which has a tendency to
eat away the fatty tissues; and it is in this manner
that they are destroyed. The excess of acid which is
thus manufactured, however, remains in the system,
and is the chief cause of resulting diseases of various
kinds.</p>

<p>In addition to all these arguments, it can be shown
that a vegetarian diet improves and renders more acute
the various senses. Sight and smell, taste and hearing—all
are influenced—in some cases more than in others.
Frequently patients are enabled to see distances or to
smell odours, after living on this diet for some weeks,
which they have never been able to do before. The
appetite no longer craves the highly-seasoned and stimulating
articles of food formerly desired, but is content
with the simpler foods. The general acuteness and sense
of well-being will more than compensate for any feeling
of deprivation that may at first follow the abolition of
meat from the diet. There can be no question that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>119</span>
food exerts a tremendous influence over the mental,
moral, and emotional life. Says Dr Haig<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe that as the result of a rational, natural
and proper diet, producing the best circulation in the
great power-house of the human body, we shall get not
only freedom from gross disease, but that we shall get,
developing gradually, conditions of mind, thought,
judgment, and morality, which will, in the future be as
different from what they have been in a diseased and
degraded past as the light of Heaven is different from
the darkness of the dungeon; and that while there are
to-day many things in human nature which all believers
in the great, and good, and true, can only most heartily
deplore, I believe that in the future there will be more
harmony, more strength, more beauty, more unselfishness,
more love—in a word, a truer and greater and
more complete <i>sanity</i>.”</p></div>

<p>It can be shown, further, that the length of individual
life as well as its usefulness and freedom from disease, are
dependent largely upon the character of the diet.
Longevity, properly so-called, is not a prolongation of
the period of decrepitude and helplessness, as some
imagine; but an extension of that period of life when
men can fully appreciate the blessings of existence. It
has been proved that any animal should live, roughly
speaking, five times as long as it takes to mature. The
dog matures at two, and lives, on an average, until it
is ten; and so on, throughout the animal world. Man,
who matures at (say) twenty, should live to be at least
one hundred, and probably more, without showing any
of the signs of decrepitude and imbecility which at
present frequently accompany old age. As a matter
of fact, we find that the average length of life is a fraction
over forty-two years; and, in addition to this, these
forty-two years are filled with diverse diseases and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>120</span>
miseries, which should at no time afflict the individual.
<i>Something</i>, therefore, is wrong, producing this result.
In some way we are consciously or unconsciously perverting
the laws of Nature. Now, in no way do we so
flagrantly and so continually pervert her laws as in this
question of food; and we can for this reason account
both for the sicknesses which occur—these being engendered
by depraved conditions of the body—and
for the shortening of life, which we perceive about us
on every hand. Philosophically, as well as practically,
this should be so. As Dr Graham pointed out years
ago: “A life cannot be both <i>in</i>tensive and <i>ex</i>tensive.”
And the more it approaches the one, the less can it approach
the other. Anything which tends to rapid living—or,
what is perhaps the same thing, rapid bodily
consumption or combustion—will consequently tend to
shorten life. All stimulants would, of course, produce
this effect; and, as meat is a highly stimulating article
of food, it will be seen that its consumption, if long continued,
will ultimately tend to devitalise and wear out
the body—for the reason that it hastens the vital wear
and tear, and consequently shortens life. This is,
further, in agreement with the fact that “the heart of
the habitual meat-eater beats from 72 to 80 beats a
minute, while that of the person living on a pure diet
of fruits, nuts, etc., will beat ten times less per minute.
Fifteen hundred extra heart strokes every twenty-four
hours makes a very appreciable strain upon the vital
forces.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>These conclusions are further borne out by the fact
that the average standard of longevity is higher among
those peoples and nations who subsist largely upon a
vegetarian diet, than among the meat-eating races.</p>

<p>There is an additional argument against meat-eating
which might be mentioned in this place. It is this:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>121</span>
That meat, being a highly stimulating article of diet,
has a tendency to make us eat <i>too much</i>, both of meat,
and of other foods, which are before us at the time.
When the meal consists largely of simple, non-stimulating
food-stuffs, it will be found that this tendency is
absent, and there will be no temptation to overeat,
or eat to excess, as is the case when meat is largely
indulged in. <i>Less</i> food, and not more, will be eaten—which
corresponds with the argument drawn from
physiology and chemistry—which shows us that we
can abstract the same amount of nutriment from less
food of another character. Instead of eating more
food, when we adopt a vegetarian diet, therefore, we
should eat less! And, as a matter of fact, most vegetarians
<i>do</i> eat less than meat-eaters. Thus, Mr Henry
Salt, in his “Logic of Vegetarianism,” p. 63, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the chemist were a man of action, and not merely
a man of study, the practical aspects of this question
might, at the outset, give him pause. Had he known
vegetarians, lived among vegetarians, and talked with
vegetarians, instead of regarding them theoretically,
he would have been aware that the average vegetarian
eats decidedly <i>less</i> in bulk than the average flesh-eater.”</p></div>

<p>This agrees with our argument advanced elsewhere—that
meat is not as nutritious as other articles of food;
and, further, when we come to consider the question of
a fruitarian diet, we shall find that cooking also destroys
a large amount of the vital properties of food, and that
less raw food may be eaten than cooked food. For
further discussion on this point, I would refer the
reader to the chapter on the quantity of food necessary
to sustain life.</p>

<p>The question of the influence of the diet upon the
mental, emotional and moral life should, perhaps, be
insisted upon a little more fully. Many of the older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>122</span>
writers have insisted on this fact very strongly, and
furnished numerous examples and illustrations of the
effects of the diet upon this side of man—either for
better or worse. Judge Woodruff, writing on this
subject, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On my return to Smyrna, I stopped at Syra.... I
there became acquainted with Dr Korke, an eminent
teacher from Switzerland. He had charge of the principal
school at Syra, containing from two hundred to
three hundred pupils.... I can truly say that these
Greek children manifested a capacity for learning which
exceeded anything I had ever before or have since witnessed.
Dr Korke attributed this extraordinary ability
in his pupils, mainly to their habits of living, which were
exceedingly simple. Coarse, unbolted wheat-meal
bread, with figs, raisins, pomegranates, olives, and other
fruit, with water, constituted their diet. Figs and other
fruit composed a large portion of their food; but I am
confident they did not consume an ounce of flesh meat
in a month.”</p></div>

<p>It is generally conceded that the eating of large quantities
of meat tends to make the consumer pugnacious
and animal-like in nature. This has been insisted
upon over and over again, and innumerable cases could
be adduced in support of this contention, if necessary.
The Tartars, who live principally on animal food, possess
a degree of ferocity of mind and fierceness of character
which form the leading feature of all carnivorous animals.
On the other hand a vegetable diet gives to the disposition,
as in the Brahmin, a mildness of feeling directly the
reverse of the former. To many, it would appear that,
if a choice had to be made, it would be better to resemble
the former class than the latter—since the one
conquers and controls and the other is conquered and
controlled. This is not invariably the case, however.
The pigmies of Africa, and the Esquimaux do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>123</span>
possess this fierce disposition, but are frequently
cowardly, and easily overruled by other European
nations. It would appear, therefore, that dietetic considerations
cannot settle this question—which is too
largely a matter of philosophy, on the one hand, and of
personal idiosyncrasy, on the other, to allow of any
definite conclusions being drawn therefrom. If we
desire to arrive at definite results, we must experiment
upon different individuals of the <i>same</i> race; and then,
by observing the <i>same</i> individuals, while upon a meat
diet, and while upon a vegetarian diet, some definite
results might be obtained.</p>

<p>There are two consequences of meat-eating which
should be noted, in this place, however—the influence
upon the passional nature, and the influence upon the
desire for alcohol. Meat, being a stimulant, excites
the bodily functions unduly—stimulating and irritating
them in an unnatural manner, and exciting the individual
to acts which he would not think of performing,
were his body less stimulated and more under control.
This is not saying that a vegetarian diet destroys or
lowers the sexual powers, or the tone of the animal
nature—far from it. But it does not keep the sexual
organs in a more or less constant state of irritation, as
is the case upon a meat diet. The potential energy is
there; but the desire to expend it so frequently is not
noted. Here is, at all events, a very important factor
in civilisation—how important, few realise (see Sanger’s
“History of Prostitution”). At all events this is one
very strong argument in favour of the vegetarian diet,
and should by no means be overlooked.</p>

<p>The relation between meat-eating and the consumption
of alcohol is now becoming widely known and recognised.
No sooner does the amount of meat consumed,
<i>per capita</i>, rise, than the quantity of alcohol
consumed rises also. The two—meat-eating and alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>124</span>-drinking—invariably
go hand in hand; and the reason
is obvious. Meat is a highly-stimulating article of food.
All stimulants call, after a time, either for an increase
in the amount of the stimulus, or for a stimulant of another
character—in order to produce the desired result.
Now, of all solid foods, there is no stimulant which is
more powerful than meat; and for that reason liquid
stimulant is sought. One stimulant craves another.
And another reason for the invariable accompaniment
of the two is this. It would be practically impossible
to create a desire for alcoholic beverages while eating
fruits, nuts and vegetables. They do not call for alcohol,
and there would be no desire for it manifested. In
every way we see, therefore, that drunkenness would be
largely abolished by the simple introduction of vegetarianism
as a diet—and this has been confirmed by
the fact that in certain sanatoriums, where the vegetarian
diet has been introduced as a cure for inebriety, it has
been found to work to perfection; and the patients,
while on this diet—and although allowed all the alcohol
they craved at first—soon ceased to want it, and the
craving left them after a few days—never to return, so
long as they maintained their reformed habits of living.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to call special attention to the
very great effects of a properly regulated vegetarian
dietary upon the body (1) when diseased; and (2) to
its power to <i>prevent</i> such diseased states. In any form
of chronic or acute disease—no matter what its nature
may be—only good will follow the adoption of a vegetarian
regimen; and the more closely this is followed,
and the more sparing and abstemious the diet—the
sooner will the patient mend and get well. And if the
vegetarian diet be adopted when the patient <i>is</i> well,
and conscientiously followed, there can be no question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>125</span>
whatever that he will <i>stay</i> well—provided he does not
eat <i>too much</i>, and that he pays reasonable attention to
the general laws of health. The preventive influence
of the diet is very profound and far-reaching.</p>

<p>But now, it may be asked, if all this be true; if
these diverse and grievous diseases that afflict man
result from the eating of meat; how comes it about
that it is such a universal article of diet? How is it
that everyone believes in its value so thoroughly?
The answer to this is simple. The majority simply
follow where custom leads, without further thought,
and without stopping to inquire into the <i>reasons</i> for
the course of life they daily pursue. But the scientists,
and the physiologists? They surely ought to know
better! They ought, indeed; but they do not seem
to! It would really appear as though this whole
doctrine of meat-eating could be traced back to the old
and fallacious dogma that we have canine teeth in our
heads! <i>They</i> have been the source and the cause of
all the trouble! But, as Dr Trall said years ago, in
writing of this very question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sometimes, when I think how perfectly ridiculous
as well as sad this carnivorous tooth blunder is, on the
part of doctors of learning and unlearned people, I am
reminded of that very beautiful experiment of a dog
running after his own tail. Take a dog, give his head
a sudden twist round towards his tail, at the same time
holding his tail in the line of his mouth, and say ‘catch
it,’ and the poor, deluded dog will run round and round
with all his might, till he falls down dizzy and exhausted,
all the while fancying himself going the straightest
possible road in pursuit of his tail. And after he has
rested a little, and recovered a little breath, he will up
and at it again.</p>

<p>“It is very much so with our flesh-eaters. The
doctors have given their heads a roundabout twist;
told them they had carnivorous teeth; set them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>126</span>
agoing; pointed to the beasts of the field, the fowls
of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and said ‘catch
them.’ And the whole world has gone to hunting and
fishing and fattening and butchering and salting and
pickling, and smoking and broiling, and frying and
eating, until they have become filled with morbid
humours, scrofula, cancer, erysipelas, gout, rheumatism,
biliousness and putrid fevers; then they have
rested a while, lived on vegetable food until they have
measurably recovered, and then resumed their carnivorous
raid in the animal kingdom!</p>

<p>“And sickness has not taught them the lesson it
ought to have done. Instead of regarding their
maladies as the necessary consequences of their eating
habits, they have looked upon them as the arbitrary
inflictions of chance, or of a mysterious Providence.
Even when, in the middle ages, the great pestilences
prevailed over Europe, at a period of the world’s
history when for three hundred years the people
literally rioted and revelled in the abundance of
flesh blood and alcoholic beverages; and when, during
those three centuries, the terrible plague—the
‘Black Death’ and the ‘Great Mortality,’ as it was
then called—desolated London, Paris, and other
great cities—sweeping off one hundred millions of
the earth’s inhabitants—the medical profession, and
the people with them, wholly mistook the lesson it
taught.</p>

<p>“And so it is now. People eat all manner of
animal products, with their morbid humours, foul
secretions, diseases, impurities and corruptions; and
when their bodies become so obstructed and befouled
that they retch, and vomit, and spit, and expectorate,
and go into fever and inflammation, and gripes and
spasms, they wonder what the matter is! And
then they send for the family physician, and he
wonders also. Why, the only wonder is that they are
not all matter!”</p></div>

<p>Throughout the whole of the above argument, I
have assumed that the meat eaten is from <i>healthy</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>127</span>
animals, and have assumed that no diseased meat
finds its way upon the table of the average meat-eater—an
assumption which is certainly not warranted by
facts. I wished, however, to give my adversaries
every advantage in this discussion, and for that reason
have assumed throughout that the meat was obtained
from healthy animals, and was not adulterated before
coming to the table. As a matter of fact, however,
neither of these two conditions are invariably fulfilled.
We might say that the second condition is very rarely
fulfilled. It is generally known that meat is inoculated
with chemicals of all kinds before it is placed upon
the market, and for that reason it is enabled to be
shipped from place to place, and to hang in the butcher’s
shop by the hour without being kept upon ice—for
how, otherwise, could this be? We know that meat
decomposes very rapidly—especially in moist or warm
weather—but it is apparently enabled to hang, nevertheless,
for hours at a time in the butcher’s shop!
If chemicals of various kinds were not injected into the
meat, this would be impossible. Most graphically does
Upton Sinclair describe this process of “pickling”
in his book, “The Jungle,” where he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Jonas has told them how the meat that was taken
out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they
would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and
sell it to be eaten on free lunch counters; also of all
the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving
to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped,
any colour and any flavour which they chose. In the
pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by
which they saved time, and increased the capacity of
the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle
attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the
meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham
with pickle m a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this,
there would be found ham spoiled, some of them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>128</span>
an odour so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in
the room with them. To pump into these the packers
had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed
the odour—a process known to the workers as ‘giving
them thirty per cent.’ Also, after the hams had been
smoked, there would be found some that had gone to
the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ‘Number
Three Grade,’ but later on, some ingenious person had
hit upon a new device, and now they would extract
the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and
insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention
there was no longer Number One, Number Two,
and Number Three Grade—there was only Number
One Grade! The packers were always originating
such schemes. They had what they called ‘boneless
hams,’ which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed
into casings; and ‘California Hams,’ which were the
shoulders, with great knuckle joints, and nearly all
the meat cut out; and fancy ‘skinned hams,’ which
were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so
heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is,
until they had been cooked, and chopped fine and
labelled ‘head cheese’!”</p></div>

<p>This question of <i>diseased meat</i> is, therefore, one which
deserves our close attention, largely because it has been
treated so ineffectually in the past, in other books
dealing with this subject. The defect has been due
to the fact that, until recently, no definite <i>facts</i> have
been available; and, although everyone knew in a
general way that much of the meat said to be “inspected”
and found free from disease was, as a matter
of fact, unfit for human food, there were no data to
which the vegetarian could point, and say: “Here are
facts and figures incontrovertible! What have you to
say in defence now?”</p>

<p>Lately, however, several such exposures have been
published. It would be well for us to summarise the
facts; and I cannot do better, in this connection, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>129</span>
to turn to Dr Albert Leffingwell’s book, “American
Meat.” (I would refer all those interested to its
fascinating pages.) A very brief summary must
suffice. This will be enough, however, for our purpose:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During the period of 1901-1906 inclusive, over
660,000 <i>post-mortem</i> inspections were made of animals,
which before slaughter had been rejected in the stock
yards as apparently diseased. Of these, only 85,000—<i>less
than one in eight</i>—were finally condemned as wholly
unfit for food purposes.... What is it that the United
States inspector is required by his regulation to condemn
as unfit for human food? The carcasses of animals
which he might find affected by cancer or
malignant tumours? No. He is directed to condemn
<i>the tumour</i>, the part of the carcass which was affected,
the organ which was infiltrated by disease! The remainder
of the carcass—what becomes of that? Is
there anything which prevents it from being turned
into the food supply of the poorer classes? There is
sometimes a silence which accords assent.... Suppose
the entire liver of a hog to be a mass of cancerous
disease; what is there in these regulations of the
Department of Agriculture to prevent transmuting
the muscular tissues and unaffected organs into various
food delicacies or food products, which in due time
should find their way to the tables of rich and poor
in England and America? Not a word!...</p>

<p>“The United States Department of Agriculture
advances yet another step, and, under certain circumstances,
<i>requires</i> the inspector’s approval of the
flesh of tuberculous animals as fit food for human
beings:</p>

<p>”<i>Rule C.</i>—The carcass, if tuberculous lesions are
limited to a single or several parts or organs of the
body (except as noted in Rule A) without evidence
of recent invasion of tubercle bacilli into the systemic
circulation, <span class="allsmcap">SHALL BE PASSED</span>, after the parts containing
the localised lesions are removed and condemned.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>130</span></p>

<p>The following table affords matter of interest:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The significance of these figures should not escape
the reader. Here is the proof, based upon official
statistics, of the utilisation for food purposes of animals
suffering from tuberculous disease!</p>

<p>But the figures prove far more. They illustrate
the terrible indifference to public interests which
governed the inspection of meat, especially before the
legislation of June, 1906. Note the vast difference
which obtains between the number of animals found
“partly” diseased in 1907, and the number of preceding
years. For instance, the total number of beef
carcasses inspected in 1907 showed an increase of
precisely 10 per cent. above the figures of 1906. Yet
the number of cattle, of which the carcasses were
“in part” condemned increased—not 10 per cent.—but
<i>over</i> 800 <i>per cent.</i> above the figures of the year
before. Almost as many hogs were condemned in one
year (1907) as “in part affected” by this disease, as
during the entire seven years that preceded it! Was
there any noteworthy sudden increase in the prevalence
of this disease among animals intended for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>131</span>
human food? There is no hint of it in the official
report. The only conclusion we can reach is that,
following the agitation and legislation of 1906, thousands
of hogs and cattle were at least partly condemned,
which in preceding years, without even the condemnation
of a part, <i>passed into the food supply of the world</i>.</p>

<p>During eight years, 1900-1907, there were slaughtered,
under Government Inspection, over 203,000,000 hogs.
Since there can be no doubt that the trichina was as
common among all the animals as among those whose
carcasses were examined, it follows that, during this
period of eight years, over 5,000,000 carcasses of hogs,
or about 1,000,000,000 <i>pounds of pork</i>, infested by
trichinæ—at least half of which at the time of slaughter
were potent for mischief—were turned into the meat
supply of an unsuspecting world!</p>

<p>The following “Government Regulations,” in this
connection, are certainly remarkable and well worth
quoting. It is hardly likely that the general public
suspects what is given to them in the form of meat;
and the following quotations will probably help to
open their eyes:</p>

<p>Similar quotations could be supplied <i>ad libitum</i>; but

From them we see that—all statements to the contrary
notwithstanding—a very great deal of diseased meat
<i>does</i> get into the market—so much, in fact, that it
becomes highly probable that a large percentage of
it is diseased; and that we probably run more chance
of buying diseased meat than we do of obtaining meat
clean and free from infection.</p>

<p>These facts and figures relate only to the meat
slaughtered under Federal Inspection, it must be remembered;
and represent the best possible condition
in which our meat is obtained. This meat is passed by
expert Government Inspectors; the packing houses are
considered the best and the cleanest in the country,
etc. What, then, of the meat killed by local butchers,
on farms, and <i>without</i> Federal Inspection altogether?
The reader may think that there are but few cattle and
hogs killed in this way; and that their flesh is not disposed
of upon the public market to any extent. If he
is of this opinion, he is sadly mistaken, as the following
figures will show. I take them from Dr A. M. Farring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>133</span>ton’s
Report to the Bureau of Animal Industry, which
is published as Circular No. 154, under the supervision
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. As we
have seen that the tendency of the Bureau is to under
rather than over-estimate the facts in the case, the
following statements will appear all the more impressive.
The figures given below relate to the year 1907,
but much the same conditions prevail to-day, and but
little has been done to check the conditions depicted.
The following is the result of a careful statistical inquiry,
in tabulated form:—</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that practically
5,000,000 cattle, nearly 8,000,000 sheep, and over
10,000,000 hogs were slaughtered by butchers in 1907
without Federal Inspection, to which may be added
about 3,000,000 calves. All these 26,000,000 animals
were consumed by the people of the United States, and
the responsibility of inspecting them rested wholly
upon the State and local authorities, since they are
beyond the reach of the Federal Inspectors.</p>

<p>And now, how about the sanitary conditions of the
slaughter-houses in which these animals were killed,
and how about the state of the animals themselves?
Were they free from disease? were they sick? Were
the surroundings filthy and poisonous in the extreme?
If I should give an account of the real state of affairs in
my own words, I should be accused of exaggeration—to
use the very mildest term. I prefer, therefore, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>134</span>
quote entirely from the Report of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, before referred to. This Report states in
part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The slaughter-houses, where animals are killed for
local consumption, are usually isolated or scattered
about the city or town.... Such houses, in addition to
being unsightly, malodorous, unclean, and insanitary
in the extreme, are actually centres for spreading
disease.... A recent investigation made by the State
Board of Health in Indiana of those slaughter-houses
which do not have Federal Inspection ...
states that:</p>

<p>“‘Of the 327 slaughter-houses inspected, only 23,
or 7 per cent., were found to fulfil the sanitary standards....
At nearly all slaughter-houses inspected, foul,
nauseating odours filled the air for yards round. Swarms
of flies filled the air and the buildings and covered the
carcasses which were hung up to cool. Beneath the
houses was to be found a thin mud, or a mixture of
blood and earth, churned by hogs, which are kept to
feed upon offal.... Maggots frequently existed in
numbers so great as to cause a visible movement of the
mud. Water for washing the meat was frequently
drawn from dug wells, which receive seepage from
the slaughter-house yards, or the water was taken
from the adjoining streams, to which the hogs had
access. Dilapidated buildings were the usual thing,
and always the most repulsive odours and surroundings
existed.’ ...</p>

<p>“One of the butchers was asked what they did with
‘sick’ cattle. He laughed and answered ‘What do they
all do with them?’</p>

<p>“In another large eastern city there are only four
slaughter-houses in the city proper which do not have
Federal Inspection. The total kill at these places is
about 1,000 cattle and 2,500 hogs per month. The only
inspection is furnished by one inspector of the board of
health, and this inspector is not a veterinarian. Previous
to his employment by the board of health, he was
a hotel porter.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>135</span></p>

<p>It need only be added that such strict economy is
practised in all these slaughter-houses that the odds
and ends—the “trimmings”—are now valued by the
butchers at about 14 per cent. of the whole. The
trimmings consist of every part of the animal except
the actual refuse it contains, everything else being
utilised in one way or another. As one Chicago packer
proudly expressed it, when speaking of hogs, “we use
everything but the squeal!”</p>

<p>This, be it observed, is the meat placed upon the
market and eaten by the American public, to the extent
of millions of carcasses yearly! Is it any wonder that
the people have cancer, and tapeworm, and tuberculosis,
and other illnesses, and break down prematurely
and become miserable and die? It would be a wonder
indeed if they did anything else!</p>

<p>It is well known that large quantities of diseased
meat are constantly being introduced and placed upon
the market—far more than the public is aware of.
But, for the present argument, it is not necessary that
we should force this conclusion, since we can establish
the point, even assuming that all the meat eaten is from
the carcasses of healthy animals—the actual content
of the tissue containing toxic material, no matter how
free the animal may be from what is generally known
as “disease.” This being true, all the arguments advanced
above will remain perfectly valid—no matter
how “healthy” the animal may be.</p>

<small>THE ARGUMENT FROM EXPERIENCE</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Nations and Individuals</i>)</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is a difference,” observes Chalmers, “between
such truths as are merely of a speculative nature, and
such as are allied with practice and moral feeling.
With the former, all repetition may be often superfluous;
with the latter, it may just be by earnest repetition
that their influence comes to be thoroughly established
over the mind of the inquirer.”</p></div>

<p>These words are particularly true when applied to the
subject matter before us. No matter how perfect,
theoretically, an argument may be, it will never appeal
to the public mind as do a few concrete facts. The
arguments I have presented, drawn from comparative
anatomy, from physiology, chemistry, and from hygiene,
would weigh but little in many minds against the testimony
of human experience. They would contend that,
no matter how good the theoretical argument might be,
the facts, nevertheless, would seem to prove the contrary;
and show that the majority of all the more
civilised people of the earth, particularly the ruling and
governing nations, <i>do</i>, as a matter of fact, eat meat;
and hence, practically, meat is a suitable article of diet.
I propose to consider these arguments in the following
chapter, and see how far they rest upon facts, and how
far upon misconception.</p>

<p>Pythagoras, one of the most celebrated philosophers
of antiquity, was one of the first to defend the “vegetable
diet.” He not only totally refrained from animal
food himself, but also strictly prohibited the use of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>137</span>
by his disciples, so that those who abstain from it at
the present time are sometimes known as Pythagorians.
Pythagoras flourished about five hundred years before
the Christian era. He was a man of immense learning,
and extraordinary powers of intellect. He was the
first demonstrator of the forty-seventh problem of the
first book of Euclid, and entertained correct views of
the solar system. Ovid speaks of him with great admiration.</p>

<p>Zeno, the Stoic, Diogenes, the Cynic, Plato, Plutarch,
Plautus, Proclus, Empedocles, Socrates, Quintus Sextus,
Apollonius of Tyana, Porphyry, and numerous others,
among the ancients, abstained from animal food and,
more recently, Haller, Ritson (celebrated for his numerous
works and varied talents), Dr Cheyne, Dr Lambe,
Mr Newton (who wrote a splendid book, “The Return to
Nature”), Shelley, Dr Hufeland, Sir Richard Phillips,
and many others have both advocated and personally
tried for many years a strictly and exclusively
vegetable diet.</p>

<p>Hesiod, the Greek poet, Herodotus, Hippocrates,
Pliny, Galen, and many other writers of antiquity could
be quoted as defending a simple, non-flesh diet. Of
late years numerous scientific men and physicians have
come forward in support of this claim; and their testimony
will be found in various parts of this work.</p>

<p>If the past has produced individual giants, mental
and physical, who subsisted upon a vegetarian dietary,
the present may also claim its champions; and there
are doubtless more at the present day than ever before.
Many athletes are now adopting a vegetarian diet,
largely on account of the Fletcher-Chittenden experiments
before referred to; largely because of individual
study and investigation. The fact that strength and
endurance are greatly increased by a strict vegetarian
or fruitarian dietary cannot be gainsaid. I have ad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>138</span>duced
some of this evidence in the chapter on hygiene,
and shall adduce further evidence in the present and
following chapters. The frequently quoted case of the
seventy-mile walking match, that took place in Germany
some years ago, should at least be referred to. Fourteen
meat-eaters, and eight vegetarians started on a seventy-mile
walking match. All the vegetarians reached the
goal, it is said in “splendid condition”—the first covering
the distance in fourteen and a quarter hours. An
hour after the last vegetarian came in, the first meat-eater
appeared, and he was “completely exhausted.”
He was also the last meat-eater to finish the race, as
all the rest had dropped off after thirty-five miles.
A further and almost exactly similar illustration is
furnished by the Dresden to Berlin walk of 1902. For
this, eighteen vegetarians and fourteen meat-eaters
started, and ten of the vegetarians, but only three of the
meat-eaters came in. The winner (Karl Mann) was
upwards of seven hours in front of the first meat-eater.
It is to be noted that Mann was a strict fruitarian, and
practically never touched the ordinary vegetarian foods.
The last meat-eater only just got in within the time
limit, and was beaten by more than four hours by a man
of fifty-nine, who had been a vegetarian for thirty-eight
years. In this race the championship of Germany was
decided, and the winner made two world’s records.
The proceedings were watched, and the organs and
circulation of competitors were measured and recorded
by a committee of physiologists, for the benefit of the
German government and army.</p>

<p>Dr Alexander Haig, in his “Diet and Food,” p. 100,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A week or two after the race I had the pleasure of
examining the winner, who had, to a large extent, arranged
his diet by the aid of a previous edition of this
book.... His circulation was far better than that of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>139</span>
meat-eater, which, to a large extent, explains his victory;
and the records show that his heart was smaller at the
end of the race than at the beginning. I have but
little doubt that the meat-eaters who gave up had
dilated hearts, owing to their obstructed circulation....
In my opinion, a few more hard facts like these
(and plenty more of such records will be forthcoming)
will quite dispel the meat-eating delusion that strength
and endurance can be attained on no food but flesh.
The truth is that 50 per cent. <i>more</i> endurance and
strength can be obtained with many other foods;
and the chief reason for this can now be seen and gauged
in a moment by the rate of the capillary circulation of
the individuals concerned; and this capillary circulation
is proportioned to the uric acid in the blood, and
is therefore slowed and obstructed by meat, which
introduces uric acid.”</p></div>

<p>Professor Baelz, of Tokio, Japan, made some experiments
on vegetarian natives, and, after measuring and
recording some of their feats of endurance, he gave some
of them meat, which they took eagerly, and regarded
as a great luxury, because it was used by the “upper
classes”; but after three days they came and begged
to be let off the meat, as they felt tired on it, and could
not work as well as before. The Professor then made
some similar experiments on himself, and he found that
he also was sooner tired, and more disinclined for exertion
when he took meat.</p>

<p>Mr Eustace H. Miles, formerly amateur champion
of the world and holder of the gold prize at tennis,
amateur champion of the world at racquets, and of
American squash, tennis, etc., is a strong advocate of
vegetarianism, and has written a number of works on
this subject, defending the non-flesh diet—which books
are too well known to need more than a mere reference.
Mr Miles, though he must be approaching middle age,
is a remarkably young-looking man, with a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>140</span>
complexion, and thinks that he will be as good ten or
fifteen years from now as he is to-day. In a conversation
with me, Mr Miles stated that he considered diet the
all-important factor, so far as health is concerned; and
exercise, and other forms of health-getting “a luxury.”
I agree with him absolutely, and defended this very
position in my “Vitality, Fasting and Nutrition,” pp.
618-621. I too think that if the food be regulated in
quality, and sufficiently reduced in quantity, all other
factors might be more or less neglected, and perfect
health maintained.</p>

<p>But it would be useless to refer to a large number of
individual cases of this character. However many I
might cite, the defenders of meat-eating would be enabled
to cite an equal number of cases in favour of
their argument; and for this reason I do not think that
individual cases are of value in establishing any conclusion
beyond this one—viz. such cases show us conclusively
that men <i>can live</i>, and <i>can maintain a high
standard of physical health and mental brilliancy upon
a diet derived exclusively from the vegetable world</i>. That
is an important point, but would not be conclusive.
In order to arrive at a definite conclusion, far larger
numbers of vegetarians and meat-eaters must be investigated;
and the question, therefore, becomes one
of statistics and of the diets of nations, rather than of
individuals. I shall accordingly turn to this aspect
of the problem—after mentioning one additional point
that must not be lost sight of, in this connection.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, throughout, that, for every
vegetarian in England or America, there are doubtless
100 or more meat-eaters, so that the percentage of
success in the athletic field and elsewhere <i>should be</i> at
least 100 to 1—and probably a great deal more, if the
balance is to be maintained between the vegetarian and
flesh-eating athletes, and others before the public eye.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>141</span>
But, as a matter of fact, we find that the percentage is
very much lower than this; and that, within the last
few years, at any rate, quite as many vegetarian athletes
secured successes and achieved records as did the meat-eating
athletes; and in some instances, where the two
ran in competition, it was found that a <i>larger</i> percentage
of vegetarian athletes achieved success than did the
meat-eaters. Inasmuch as the number is so disproportioned,
in the two cases, it would certainly appear that
the vegetarian athletes did, on the whole, achieve a far
greater percentage of successes than did the meat-eating
athletes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The diets of the various nations have so frequently
been summarised and presented by writers upon this
subject that it will not be necessary for me to do more
than to mention briefly a few of the most essential
points; and to refer the reader to those works in which
these facts and arguments are to be found in full. Dr
Graham, in his “Science of Human Life”; Dr John
Smith, in his “Fruit and Farinacea”; Dr Anna Kingsford,
in her “Perfect Way in Diet,” and, more recently
and fully, the Hon. Rollo Russell, in his extensive
volume, “Strength and Diet: A practical treatise
with special regard to the life of nations”—all these
writers have discussed this question of national
health, as compared with national diet, and found,
almost invariably, that in every nation whose diet
consisted almost exclusively or even largely of meat,
the natives were small in stature, depraved mentally
and morally, and afflicted with diverse diseases;
whereas those nations which were largely vegetarian
did not suffer in the same way from the sicknesses and
pestilences that affected their fellow-men; but were,
on the contrary, more forceful, superior morally and
mentally, and in every way higher in the scale of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>142</span>
evolution than those nations which subsisted largely
upon meat.</p>

<p>A striking example of this is to be found in the pigmy
races of Central Africa. In his work, “The Pigmies,”
Professor A. de Quatrefages has shown us that this
miniature people, stunted as they are, mentally, physically
and morally, subsist almost entirely upon meat.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The <a id="Mincopies"></a>Mincopies are exclusively hunters and fishermen,
living upon the shore of a sea filled with fishes,
close to great forests where boars run at large, and
which furnish them, besides, honey and nuts, they
have not felt the necessity of wringing by labour from
the soil, a supplement to their food supply; and this
very luxuriance of food, perhaps, has been of influence
in keeping them at the lowest point in the social scale.
Francis Day informs us that a very small tribe of
Mincopies camped near the English establishments,
and receiving daily rations, took besides, in a single
year, five hundred boars, one hundred and fifty turtles,
twenty wild cats, fifty guianas and six bugongs....
All the descriptions agree in attributing to the Akkas,
men and women, an extreme abdominal development,
which causes the adults to resemble the children
of Arabs and negroes.... But it is evident the
abnormal development of the abdomen, among the
Akkas, is not a true race characteristic, but that it is
largely due to their manner of life, the quantity of
their food, perhaps also to the general conditions of
their habitat. This fact results from some observations
of Count Minis Calchi, who has seen, after some weeks
of regular and wholesome diet, the extreme development
of the abdomen disappear, and the vertebral
column resume its normal state.”</p></div>

<p>These people are described as cruel, cowardly and
wanting in all the qualities that would raise them in the
scale of evolution: yet their diet consists almost entirely
of meat—the supposed “strengthening” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>143</span>
courage-breeding food of civilised nations! Emaciation
is very common among them, under certain conditions.
It cannot be objected to what I have said that
this condition is brought about by their cannibalism,
for we read (“The Pigmies,” p. 155) that: “Far
from seeking human flesh, the Andamanese regard it
as a deadly poison.”</p>

<p>The Esquimaux are another race which is very inferior;
and in them nothing is developed, scarcely,
save the mere animal nature; hence their stomachs
have all the nervous power, almost, of their whole
constitutions. They have virtually no mental life
beyond that necessary for carrying on the affairs of
daily life. One never hears of any mental achievement
coming from an Esquimau; more than this, their
animal nature is itself actually inferior in muscular
power to that of those tribes and races of men whose
general régime is comparatively free from fats and
animal oils.</p>

<p>Throughout history the general run of the people—the
natives—subsisted almost entirely upon a vegetarian
diet; and any large quantity of meat was not
consumed, for the reason that it could not be procured.
The upper classes subsisted more or less upon meat—which
might have accounted for their eventual degeneracy!—as
the whole nation degenerated when
meat-eating became general, as in Greece and Rome.
But in the early stages of the history of these nations,
and of others, meat was a luxury, to be eaten on holidays
and fête days, rather than a steady article of diet;
it could by no means be procured every day or every
meal, as is now the case. The principal food of the
natives of Egypt, India, Mexico, Chili, Brazil, Cyprus,
Arabia, Bolivia, the Canary Islands, Italy, Ceylon,
Japan, Sierra Leone, Greece, Malta, Turkey, China,
Palestine, Algiers, the African Coast, Poland, Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>144</span>
Norway, Spain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Prussia,
Saxony, Bavaria, Sweden, Switzerland, Scotland, Ireland,
and, until recently, England—is some form of
vegetarian food—bread, rice, fruits, cheese, and various
grains. The details of these dietaries are to be found
in Russell’s “Strength and Diet,” where a very full
summary of all these dietaries are to be found. I refer
my reader to that work for further information upon
these lines. But one or two examples are needed to
illustrate this. Thus we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is indeed surprising to see how simple and poor
is the diet of the Egyptian peasantry, and how robust
and healthy most of them are, and how severe is the
labour they undergo. The boatmen of the Nile are
mostly strong muscular men, rowing, poling and
towing continually; but very cheerful and often the
most so when most occupied, for they amuse themselves
by singing.”</p></div>

<p>The staple food of India is, of course, rice, to which
is added a poor grain called râgi, pulse, roots, fruits,
and one or two other articles of diet. The men from
the hilly district are described as tall—being from five
feet ten inches, to six feet high. They used to carry the
mail from Calcutta to Bombay by foot—but twenty-five
days being allowed for this journey, an average of
sixty-two miles a day.</p>

<p>Few people surpass the Arabs for longevity, agility,
and power of endurance; yet they subsist largely
upon dates, milk, and honey. The peasants of Italy
are a splendid, hardy set, living almost entirely upon
cakes and porridge of chestnut, bread, garlic, and a
little wine. The Greek boatmen are exceedingly
abstemious, their food consisting of a small quantity
of black bread, made of unbolted rye or wheat meal,
a bunch of grapes or raisins, figs, etc. They are ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>145</span>tremely
vigorous and active, as well as blithesome,
jovial and full of hilarity. Sir William Fairbairn, in
his “Report on Sanitary Conditions,” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The boatmen and water carriers of Constantinople
are decidedly, in my opinion, the finest men in Europe,
as regards their physical development, and they are
all water drinkers; they take a little sherbet at times.
Their diet is chiefly bread, now and then a cucumber,
with cherries, figs, dates, mulberries, or other fruits
which are abundant there; now and then a little
fish.”</p></div>

<p>In Dr Mackenzie Wallace’s “Russia,” we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Eggs, black bread, milk and tea—these form my
ordinary articles of diet during all my wanderings in
northern Russia. Occasionally a potato could be had,
and afforded the possibility of varying the bill of
fare.... The people of Russia generally subsist on
coarse black rye bread, and garlics. I have often hired
men to labour for me in Russia, which they would do
from sixteen to eighteen hours, for eight cents a day.
They would come on board in the morning with a piece
of their black bread weighing about a pound, and a
bunch of garlics as big as one’s fist. This was all their
nourishment for the day of sixteen or eighteen hours
labour.”</p></div>

<p>The fare of the Swiss workmen is very frugal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They rarely taste flesh, their food being principally,
bread, cheese, potatoes, vegetables and fruit, though in
the towns the consumption of meat is somewhat greater.
The middle classes fare pretty much as the working
classes, all consuming large quantities of milk.”</p></div>

<p>Mr H. Irving Hancock, in his “Japanese Physical
Training,” says of their diet:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When making their phenomenal marches, Japanese
troops often carry no food except a small bag of rice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>146</span>
When practicable, barley and beans are issued in small
quantities, though this is only done for the sake of
adding variety to the diet.... A bowl of this grain
(rice) and a handful of fish is considered an ample meal
for the coolie who is called upon to perform ten or
twelve hours of hard manual work in a day.”</p></div>

<p>It would be possible to add quotations and references
such as the above <i>ad lib.</i>; but it is hardly essential
for our argument, since this has been done so frequently
by able writers on the vegetarian diet, that it hardly
needs recapitulation in this place. Anyone may test
the value of the diet for himself, and thus verify from
that most satisfactory of all sources—personal experience—what
has been outlined here, as a theoretical
possibility. Before closing, however, I desire to call
attention to one or two aspects of this question which
have been more or less overlooked, or wrong inferences
drawn from the facts—apparently vitiating the argument,
and showing that meat-eating has a substantial
basis, and that there are valid objections to the vegetarian
dietary that have hitherto been lost sight of.
Let us consider these briefly.</p>

<p>One great argument will always be raised against
this theory of vegetarianism, or non-flesh-eating—at
first sight a very rational objection. It will be said
that all the nations who are flesh-eating are the most
progressive and dominating races or nations; and
that those who are largely vegetarian on principle are
invariably overruled by the nations who eat meat.
The old case of the Hindu and the Englishman may be
cited here: it being contended that the meat-eating
Englishman dominates and holds in check the vast
hordes of India, and this largely or exclusively on
account of his meat diet! Many other examples of
this character might be referred to, and in fact a strong
case apparently made out from these arguments alone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>147</span>
I do not think that the argument is in any way valid,
however; for the following reasons, among others:—</p>

<p>In the first place, the Hindu is the man he is—peaceful,
docile, kind—more on account of his philosophy
than on account of his diet. He is opposed to
killing and bloodshed in any form whatever, and will
not kill any animal (except, very occasionally, a snake)
because of his belief in reincarnation and the transmigration
of souls. It can readily be seen, therefore,
that, holding such beliefs as these, and being naturally
of a philosophic and introspective turn of mind, and
being, moreover, a rural, rather than a warlike people,
killing their fellow-men would not appeal to them
as it does to us. With them, the aim and object of
life is, not to acquire material possessions, but true
spiritual progress. They look upon material possessions
as so much ephemeral matter, which shall count for very
little, when compared with the ultimate destiny of the
human soul. European nations, on the other hand,
who consider the material nature only, cannot understand
that attitude of mind; they are so saturated with
materialism and the materialistic thoughts of the age
that they cannot even conceive the viewpoint of one
such as the Hindu, who considers and values only the
immaterial. Both consider the other as dreamers,
and as victims of illusion—people carried away by vain
baubles—in the quest of mere delusions! Holding such
views, therefore, it can hardly be wondered at that
Hindus should view with more or less indifference the
conquests and despotism of foreign nations: to them
these are mere incidents in the passing of one life.
This argument can, therefore, hardly be pressed against
the Hindus and similar nations; it is invalid, for these
reasons alone.</p>

<p>Again, it must be admitted that the highest evidence
of civilisation—the most advanced evidences of evolu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>148</span>tion—are
hardly those of war and bloodshed, but rather
peace and tolerance! As a friend of mine expressed
it: “If you mean that those nations are the most
advanced and progressive which shoulder a gun and
go out and kill their fellow-man, then I must admit
that European nations are the most advanced; but
if you mean anything else, this cannot be said.”</p>

<p>As Dr Trall, when discussing this question, remarked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If it be alleged, as an argument against the position
I am endeavouring to occupy, that the milder and more
civilised and peaceful nations are degraded and enslaved
by their more ferocious and warlike neighbours, I can
merely reply that human beings may, and in fact do,
like predacious animals, riot upon and tyrannise over
the more amiable and more lovely, as the wolf preys
upon the lamb, and the vulture upon the dove. And
I can see no end or remedy for this seeming cruelty—save
in that law of benevolence and progress which
permits suffering for a season, and as a means of development,
and overrules all for good, by that law which,
in due process of time, will not only exterminate from
the face of the earth the beasts of prey, but also all the
appetences of human beings for preying upon other
animals.”</p></div>

<p>Lastly, I must contend that it is by no means invariably
the case that vegetarian nations are subservient
to the meat-eating; but they are, on the contrary,
almost invariably superior to them physically, as well
as mentally and spiritually. The Japanese have only
lately given us an excellent example of this fact; and
it is illustrated in the histories of all nations. It might
almost be said that meat-eating nations have never
stood at the head of the military world until recently.
The Greeks and Romans were not meat-eating, but were
strictly vegetarian, for the most part; when meat-eating
and wine-drinking and debauchery generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>149</span>
were introduced, the Government speedily disintegrated
and went to pieces. The same is true of
every nation of which we have any authentic account.
The great mass of the people were always vegetarian,
and must have been. Even a hundred or so years ago
meat was considered a luxury, and was served only on
special occasions; bread and vegetables were eaten
the rest of the year. Even in our own day, the majority
of the peasantry in all countries are almost entirely
vegetarian, and only in the large cities can the very
poor buy meat. A brief glance at the “diets” of
various nations will confirm this statement.</p>

<p>There is slightly more excuse for natives of frigid or
temperate zones eating meat than there is for any inhabitant
of the tropics; but, as a matter of fact, when
an inhabitant of the temperate zone <i>does</i> visit the
tropics, he still clings to his meat diet—his rich, greasy
dishes, his wines, and his roast beef! Even upon his
own showing these should be largely sacrificed, when
visiting the hot countries; and yet, as a matter of fact,
they are not given up—showing the illogical stand taken
by those who defend the flesh diet, and conclusively
proving that it is merely a matter of habit and prejudice
rather than bodily requirements. Mr Salt, in
his “Logic of Vegetarianism,” has indeed tersely and
wittily summed up this argument as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—Vegetarianism? No thank you;
not here! All very nice in Africa and India, I dare say,
where you can sit all day under a palm tree and eat
dates.</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—But I have not observed that when
you visit Africa or India you practise vegetarianism. On
the contrary, you take your flesh-pots with you everywhere—even
to the very places where you admit you
don’t need them, and where, as in India, they give the
greatest offence to the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>150</span></p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—Oh, well, it’s no affair of theirs, is
it, if I take my roast beef?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—Yet you think it your affair to interfere
with the cannibals when they take their roast man.
And have you observed that it is in the tropical zone,
not the temperate zone, that cannibalism is most
rife?</p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—Why do you remind me of that?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—To show you that all this talk about
vegetarianism being ‘a matter of climate’ is pure
humbug. The use of flesh is a vicious habit everywhere,
and nowhere a necessity, except where other food is
not procurable.</p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—But do we not need more oil and
fat in northern climates?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—Undoubtedly; but these can be
obtained without recourse to flesh.</p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—Then how do you account for the
fact that northern races have been, to so great an extent,
carnivorous?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—Perhaps because in primitive times
hunting and pasturage were less toilsome than agriculture.
But I am not called on to ‘account’ for such a
fact. Their past addictedness to flesh food no more
proves the present utility of flesh-eating, than their
gross drinking habits prove the utility of alcohol.</p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—Can you quote any scientific
authority for your contention?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—There is one which is all the more
valuable because it is an admission made by an opponent.
Sir William Lawrence wrote: ‘That men can be
perfectly nourished, and that their physical and intellectual
capabilities can be fully developed in any climate
by a diet purely vegetable, has been proved by such
abundant experience that it will not be necessary to
adduce any formal argument on the subject.’ ‘In any
climate,’ mark! And a diet ‘purely vegetable’;
whereas all <i>you</i> are asked to do is to forego the actual
flesh foods, and not the animal products. But come
now, let me ask the great question!</p>

<p>“<i>British Islander.</i>—What is that? There is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>151</span>
one other I have in mind. What would become of the
Esquimaux?</p>

<p>“<i>Vegetarian.</i>—Of course! I have always been profoundly
touched by the disinterested concern of the
Englishman (when vegetarianism looms ahead) for the
future of that arctic people. Well, perhaps the question
of what ice-bound savages might do or might not do,
need scarcely delay the decision of civilised mankind.
For that matter, what would become of the polar
bears? If you cannot dissociate your habits from
those of the Esquimaux, why don’t you eat blubber?
At least they have a better reason for eating blubber
than some people have for eating beef—they can get
nothing else.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<p>This whole question of diet, so far as it is decided by
experience at all, can in reality be summed up in a very
few words. In the first place, all that it is necessary for
anyone to do is to experiment upon himself. Let him
study the subject sufficiently, first of all—so that he
may be sure he is balancing his diet properly, when the
meat is discarded; and then give up meat, and continue
the new dietary for a year or so—or even a few weeks,
for that matter. The result will soon be apparent. In
the next place, it is ridiculous to raise the question at
all, as a matter of fact—as to its “possibility”—when
we consider that seven-tenths of the inhabitants of
the whole globe are vegetarians! They are not the
scattered few, here and there, as the majority suppose;
but the great bulk of the people in every country. The
peasantry in every land have always subsisted almost
exclusively upon fruits, grains and vegetables; and it
is only recently, when the price of meat has been so
greatly reduced, and the average wages of the people
increased, that they have been enabled to buy meat at
all, with any regularity. Meat-eaters have always been
in the minority—and have, as a rule, shown signs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>152</span>
degeneracy before many centuries or even generations
have passed. To anyone knowing these facts, it is
little less than absurd to speak of the “impossibility”
of subsisting without flesh-foods! It displays the
greatest short-sightedness.</p>

<p>Dr Trall, in writing upon this question some years
ago, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They say that vegetable food is not sufficiently
nutritious. But chemistry proves the contrary. So
does physiology. So does experience. Indeed, it can
be demonstrated that many kinds of fruit are nearly as
nutritious as flesh. Many kinds of vegetables are quite
as much so, and the grains and nuts several times as
nutritious. They allege that human beings cannot
have permanent strength without the use of animal food,
right in face of the fact that the hardest work is now
being done, and has always been done, by those who
use the least animal food; and right in the face of the
fact, too, that no flesh eating animals can endure prolonged
and severe labour. I should like to see them
try the experiment of working a lion or a tiger, or a
hyena against an ox, a camel, or a mule. Examples
exist here and there, all over the world, of men of extraordinary
powers of endurance who do not use animal
food at all; and history is full of such examples in all
ages of the world. And again: the largest and strongest
animals in the world are those which eat no flesh-food
of any kind—the elephant and rhinoceros.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<p>I cannot refrain here from alluding to the most
common objection to vegetarianism we meet with in this
country; and I do so for the purpose of explaining it
away. The objection is, that vegetarians are themselves
poor specimens of health. And the answer is
that the great majority of those who are the subjects of
notice and comment are invalids who are restricted to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>153</span>
vegetable diet, because they can recover health in no
other way; and many of them are living on a strict
vegetable regimen because it is the only way they can
live at all. At the various hydropathic establishments
in this country the most desperate cases are put on a
vegetable diet, simply because it affords them the best
chance of getting well. The casual observer, who
judges by appearances, will always find an argument
in favour of flesh-eating in the fact that the best-looking
persons, physiologically, are those who eat meat.</p>

<p>There are, however, scattered, in America, in
England and elsewhere, many persons who will not
suffer by comparison, either physical or mental, with the
flesh-eaters of any country that can be found. In
bodily vigour and in mental capacity they are equal
to any meat-eaters. Let us consider this a little more
fully.</p>

<p>It is usually thought that athletes cannot be developed
upon a non-meat diet (though the fallacy of this argument
has long since been disproved, in reality). It will
be well to give a few instances, from among many, of
the success of vegetarians over their opponents. It is
true that these have not been numerous, but then,
there are but few vegetarian athletes; and <i>proportionately</i>
their triumphs have been singularly frequent. A
useful summary of some of these successes is given in
Mr Charles Forward’s book, “The Food of the Future.”
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the latter part of the year 1880 Gaston de
Bennet, a young Austrian, 17 years of age, and a vegetarian
of the strictest sect, using neither eggs nor milk,
won the first prize in a grand swimming contest in Lord
Harlick’s Park ... against 11 flesh-eaters, most of them
full-grown men. He also won the first prize in the
‘Cooler’ race, and, though well drenched, kept his wet
clothes on for hours, and took no harm. As a flesh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>154</span>
eater, he had been extremely delicate, very subject to
cold, and constantly taking physic.</p>

<p>“In the year 1884, the Brothers Whatton and Mr
A. W. Rumnay, as representatives of Cambridge, in the
inter-university races, carried all before them—a fact
which directed considerable public attention to their
vegetarian dietary.</p>

<p>“The first path race of the vegetarian cycling club
took place in 1891, but it was not until 1893 that the
performances of Messrs S. H. Potter, H. Sharp, and
W. Kilby, turned out so far in advance of previous work
that the Committee decided upon issuing a Club Challenge
Shield. During 1895, two of its members ...
gained first and second prizes, in the North London
Club’s Road Race; and, in the same year, Mr H. E.
Brinning wrested the Club Challenge Shield from Mr
Warlow, who had won it a year previously.</p>

<p>“Since then, Mr Brinning had been to Calcutta, and
soon after his arrival, won from scratch nearly every
race he competed in, besides becoming possessor of
three challenge shields put up for competition in Calcutta,
and securing the cycling championship of India.</p>

<p>“The achievements of the members of the Vegetarian
Cycling Club were much discussed in vegetarian circles
all over the world; and particularly among German
vegetarians; and when, in 1893, a walking competition
took place from Berlin to Vienna, several vegetarians
were amongst the competitors, who numbered 16 in all.
The winner was Otto Peitz, who reached the judge’s
box at 4.40 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, on the 4th of June. About an hour
later, another vegetarian, Elsässer, arrived. No other
competitors arrived until about 22 hours later, when, at
about 3 o’clock on the following day, Carl Nauhaus
passed the post. He was not a vegetarian, but he expressed
the opinion that it was a mistake to eat much
flesh on a long walk. The fourth arrival was a Berlin
university law student, arriving on the sixth of June, at
6.52, whilst a few minutes later Fritz Goldbach reached
the Committee Box. Dr Heller, a Vienna physician,
and an opponent of vegetarianism, partook of raw flesh
on the journey; but on the second day he began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>155</span>
reconsider the task before him, and he subsequently
posted a dispatch to the Committee, announcing his
withdrawal from the contest, and went on to Vienna by
train. Owing to a technical breach of the rules, Elsässer
put in a claim for the gold medal. He had been a strict
vegetarian for over four years, not even using eggs, milk,
butter or cheese. All that he took during his walk was
bread, fruit and water, and, on one or two occasions, a
glass of seltzer. He had undergone no regular training
at all. Otto Peitz, who secured the second prize, consumed
bread and butter, and occasionally eggs and milk.
He was a compositor by trade, and being poor, had to
‘rough it,’ not being able to pay for a bed during the
walk....</p>

<p>“On the 21st of January, 1894, the ‘Winter Walk’
of the German Long Distance Walk Society took place,
the route being from Berlin to Fredericksburg, a distance
of about 30 miles. The roads were soft and muddy, and
the weather rainy and windy. Of the first four competitors
who arrived at the winning post, two were
vegetarians—namely, Frederick Bruhn and Carl Harmann.
That the result of these walking matches was
no mere ‘fluke’ is clear from the fact that the vegetarian
competitors have repeated their successes on subsequent
occasions; and impartial students of dietetics
were ready to admit the soundness of the vegetarian
position.”</p></div>

<small>MISCELLANEOUS ARGUMENTS</small></h2></div>


<p>In the five preceding chapters I have advanced a
number of reasons for thinking that the natural diet of
man is vegetarian or fruitarian, and have endeavoured
to show why flesh-eating is injurious. We saw that,
from anatomical structure, from physiological function,
from chemical analysis, for hygienic reasons, and
because of the past experience of nations and individuals—for
all these reasons man should abstain from meat.
In the present chapter I shall adduce a number of miscellaneous
arguments, tending to show that flesh is not
man’s natural food; and that he cannot make it an
article of his diet without violating many of the laws
of his organisation—mental and moral, as well as physiological.
These laws are important, also, and have their
rightful place, just as mental and moral considerations
have their place in any other question; and I shall
accordingly consider them here.</p>

<p>There is first of all the humanitarian argument. This
argument is perfectly legitimate, so far as it goes, and a
most forceful one. The idea of taking life unnecessarily
is very repellant to some—those who have not become
hardened, and who have thought of this matter at all.
To see a cartload of young animals going to the slaughter-house
is a sad if not a disgusting sight—especially when
we consider that these animals are soon to be cut up,
and made into human food! The ill-treatment which
the animals receive, during shipment, is certainly not
in favour of their flesh being in any too good condition
when it is received at the slaughter-house; and, if
mental conditions count for anything, in their effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>157</span>
upon the composition of the blood and tissue juices,
there is very good reason for thinking that their
bodies are pretty well poisoned before they are killed—even
if they were healthy when they left the stock-farm.
But, apart from such considerations, every animal has
its right to live; the ox and the calf, and the sheep, and
even the swine, has its mental life, just as man; and
there is a universal life running throughout the animal
kingdom, which it is no part of man’s duty to take
needlessly. This brings me to a very important factor
in the argument. It is the taking of life <i>needlessly</i>
which the vegetarian protests against so strongly. If
it were necessary to kill these animals; if man could not
live without flesh, then killing and eating would be
perfectly justifiable. It would simply be a case of the
survival of the fittest, and man would be entitled to
kill and eat other animals, just as the carnivora do.
But it is not necessary in any degree. Man can live
perfectly well without meat of any kind; and not only
live as well, but far better! My arguments in the
chapter devoted to the hygiene of this subject should
prove that to the satisfaction of the reader. Man can
live without animal flesh; consequently the eating of
this flesh is purely to gratify an appetite—and a perverted
appetite at that. No normal appetite could
possibly crave flesh of any kind. So that there is no
possible excuse for the killing and eating of animals,
than this—except, of course, ignorance. After all, that
is the greatest factor!</p>

<p>It is against this taking of life unnecessarily that the
vegetarian protests not the taking of life at all.
Besides, there is a difference between killing a highly
organised and sensitive animal, and one far lower in
the scale of Evolution. Shedding the blood of such
animals is against all normal instincts. Said a lady
once, to a gentleman who was eating beef: “How can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>158</span>
you eat a thing that looks out of the eyes?” The
very plaintiveness, coupled with the helplessness of such
animals, should inspire a certain pity in the breasts of
all who have any humanitarian instincts.</p>

<p>This aspect of the controversy throws a different and
a more rational light upon this question. It has frequently
been contended, <i>e.g.</i>, that, if this humanitarian
argument were carried far enough, it would become
absurd, for the reason that every drop of water we
drink, and every breath of air we breathe contains
living animals, which we kill within our bodies! Moreover,
every vegetable we cut or pick, takes life (such as
it is) and consequently this argument cannot be carried
to its logical conclusion, and is consequently worthless!</p>

<p>The position I have indicated above answers this
objection. If we cannot live without taking the lives
of certain animalculæ, or that of certain plants, then we
must take their lives (for the most part, be it noted,
unconsciously). But there is a great difference between
this and taking the lives of highly organised animals
intentionally and voluntarily. Besides, the one is
necessary, the other not. As I said before, if meat were
a necessary article of diet, there could be no possible
objection to making it an article of food; but it is <i>not</i>
necessary. That is the <i>crux</i>.</p>

<p>Further, it can be shown that, on a fruitarian diet,
it is not necessary to take the life even of the fruit eaten!
If a cabbage be cut, <i>e.g.</i>, we thereby kill the cabbage—its
psychic life, that is. The same is true of all other
vegetables. But it will be observed that, when fruits
are eaten, nothing is destroyed; no life taken unnecessarily.
Fruits, when they are ripe, fall from the tree,
and rot upon the ground—thus exposing the seed, and
allowing it to become buried in the soil. It will be
seen that the pulp of the fruit is of no further use to the
seed; it has nourished it up to the time of its falling to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>159</span>
the ground, but thenceforward, it is virtually useless
to the seed. So that we might with justice feel that we
were taking no life at all in eating this pulp of the fruit—which,
again, would seem to indicate that fruit is
man’s natural diet.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> However, as I said before, I do
not think it is necessary to split hairs so finely on this
question. The valid ground to take is that it is wrong
and cruel to take highly organised life uselessly; and I
do not think that such an attitude is in any way open
to criticism.</p>

<p>I may as well answer, in this place, one objection
that has been frequently raised against vegetarians by
the meat-eaters, which is that, if we did not eat meat,
we should soon be overrun by the various animals, and
there would be no room for man upon the earth!
They would eventually crowd man out! This supposed
argument is really absurd. In the first place, hardly
one-tenth of the animals now brought into the world
would be raised. They are now especially bred for
eating purposes, and if the demand decreased, the supply
would decrease also. Further, how is it that we are not
overrun by wild animals of all sorts? We have never
been in any danger from <i>them</i>, somehow; but it has
invariably been found that they tend to recede before
the advance of civilisation. Many survive, to be sure,
but Nature seems to take care that their numbers are
not unduly increased, so as to be a menace to the human
race. If this be true of wild animals—which might
really be a menace to the human race, if their numbers
were sufficiently increased—it is certainly all the more
true of the harmless domestic animals. Nature would</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>160</span></p>
<p>see to it that man was not overrun by animals of any
sort, as she always has in the past. People need not
worry about the future welfare of the bovine race, if
they would only be a little more humane in their treatment
of its present representatives!</p>

<p>There is an ethical and an æsthetic aspect of diet, just
as there is a hygienic and chemical aspect. There is a
wider view of this question of diet than merely that of
supplying the body with pabulum for the tissues;
the body itself cannot be built equally well from all
food-stuffs, but the body is cleaner and internally purer
on some foods than upon others. The keeping of the
body in a clean, pure state—a fit tenant for the soul—is
in itself an aspect of the diet problem that should affect
us most keenly. It is not as though food had no effect
upon mental life and morals. Far from it. There is
the closest inter-relation. The whole process of ingesting
food is disgusting, in one sense, but that is no
excuse for choosing, in consequence, carrion and offal
to feed upon! Think of the condition of a man’s
stomach who has eaten a regular <i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner, and
compare it, in the mind’s eye, with the stomach of a
man who has dined on peaches and Brazil nuts! Were
one to stop and think of what meat <i>is</i>, and what it <i>was</i>,
it is doubtful if one could eat it. It is merely dead and
decaying flesh—flesh from the body of an animal.
There is nothing more repellent to think about than the
“scorched corpses,” as Bernard Shaw calls them, which
grace the tables of so-called civilised people. The sight,
the smell, the taste, all are repellent. Only by the fact
that they are covered up, and their true nature concealed
by cooking, and basting, and pickling, and peppering
and salting can we eat them at all. If we were
naturally carnivorous animals, we should delight in
bloodshed and gore of all kind! We should go out and
kill our dinner, just as we now eat it; and the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>161</span>
would seem no more repulsive to us than the other.
Carnivorous animals secure their food in this way, and
so should we, if we were naturally carnivorous. We
should eat our flesh warm and quivering—just as it
comes from the cow! But instead of this, what do we
find? That the majority of people in civilised nations
will not even consent to go near a slaughter-house!
And when they <i>do</i> go, they come away sickened at the
sights and the odours which they encounter. Take for
example the following extracts from a diary—the notes
being descriptive of a Chicago meat market:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Slithered over bloody floor. Nearly broke neck in
gore of old porker. Saw few hundred men slicing pigs,
making hams, sausages, and pork chops. Whole sight
not edifying; indeed, rather beastly. Next went to the
cattle killing house. Cattle driven along gangway and
banged over head with iron hammer. Fell stunned: then
swung up by legs, and man cuts throats. Small army
of men with buckets catching blood; it gushed over
them in torrents—a bit sickening. Next went to sheep
slaughter-house. More throat-cutting—ten thousand
sheep killed a day—more blood. Place reeks with
blood; walls and floor splashed with it, air thick, warm,
offensive. Went and drank brandy....”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p>And so would anyone else who had witnessed like
scenes! I say <i>witnessed</i> them merely: how would it
be if each one had to perform the actual process of
killing, before he could have a piece of his “delicious
beef-steak”? How would our society women like to
spend the morning in a slaughter-house, before they
could procure their meat for the evening dinner? And
yet <i>someone</i> has to do this work—work disgusting and
degrading enough to be below the lowest of men, and
fit only for the lowest of animals. The butcher does
this, you say; he is paid for it? Very true, but he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>162</span>
only learns to do this work after many days and even
weeks of revulsion; and it is invariably against his
nature to do it. And this brings me to one very important
factor—the degradation of the butcher. Of
all recognised occupations by which in civilised countries
a livelihood is sought and obtained, the work which is
looked upon with the greatest loathing (next to the
hangman’s) is that of the butcher. He becomes depraved
mentally, morally and physically. His is a
dangerous business, and it is well known that slight
cuts and scratches, which, in the average man, would
amount to very little, frequently cause blood-poisoning
and death to the butcher. Their work brutalises them,
too—as it necessarily must. This is well known; and
butchers are forbidden to sit in a jury, in certain
countries, as we know, because of the perversion of their
moral natures. And all this because certain persons,
under the delusion that they “must have meat” demand
this from these men! The crime, and the ugly, dirty
work in connection with meat-eating, does not rest upon
the butchers—who are paid for their work, and would
doubtless starve, lacking it—it rests upon the eaters of
meat throughout the country! As the Whitechapel
butcher remarked to the flesh-eating gentlemen: “It’s
such as <i>you</i> makes such as <i>us</i>!” Yes; the stain rests
upon the flesh-eaters, not upon the flesh providers!</p>

<p>But there is another argument in favour of the
vegetarian diet, and more especially in favour of the
fruitarian diet, as against meat-eating. It is that any
given area of land will supply far more food per acre
in the one case than in the other. When the soil is
given up to the feeding of cattle, upon which man is to
feed, the given area of land would supply far less
nutriment, so to speak, than would the same soil, if
grains were raised upon it; and that would give
less, in turn, than if fruit-trees were grown upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>163</span>
Dr Smith pointed out this fact in his “Fruits and Farinacea”
years ago; and stated that twenty times the
population could be supported upon a diet of grains,
coming from a given limited area, than could be supplied,
if that area were devoted to the raising of cattle.
And far more would this be the case if fruits were grown
upon this same area. It is safe to say that, if one
person could be fed from a certain area of land, provided
he ate the meat it produced, ten could be fed
from the same area, upon grains and cereals, and twenty
upon the fruits and nuts such an area could provide.
This fact is in itself of great importance and significance.
Although the time is doubtless far distant when man
will have to figure so closely on his land space for feeding
the people, that time must come some day; and it
would be well to know that many more persons can be
fed from the same area of ground upon one diet than
upon another.</p>

<p>These and many other arguments could be urged
against the practice of meat-eating. They are all
valid arguments, though all of them, in my estimation,
subordinate to the hygienic argument. If it were
necessary to kill animals, in order to live, I should have
no compunction in doing so; but as it is not necessary,
I must protest against this useless waste of life; and
more especially so since this meat is positively pernicious
and harmful to the system. There is a sort of half-formulated
idea in men’s minds that they must have
meat, because the blood is <i>red</i>, and because the blood
of their own bodies is red; and they think that, by
eating large quantities of meat, they can increase the
quantity and improve the quality of their own blood—thereby
curing anæmia, etc.! Of course there is no
foundation at all for this superstition. In the first
place, the tables of the chemical values of the various
foods show us conclusively that meat is far <i>less</i> nutri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>164</span>tious
than many other articles of diet; while it contains,
in addition, certain poisons which are extremely harmful
to the system. Further, all food, no matter what
its nature, is converted into a creamy substance known
as chyle before it is appropriated by the system; and,
no matter what the food may be, it is resolved into this
cream-coloured chyle before it is digested. Where,
then, is the “good, red blood” of the meat? And I
have previously shown that, although there are practically
no chemical differences between the chyme formed
from vegetable and that formed from animal substances,
nevertheless, the vital properties of the chyme vary
greatly—and are in favour of the vegetable foods.
Finally, I would point out that, if this argument were
sound, we should not eat the flesh of animals, for the
reason that “it most nearly resembles our own,” but
would become cannibals and eat <i>human</i> flesh—since
<i>that</i> most nearly resembles our tissues! And yet it
has been found by actual experiment, that, so far
from being wholesome food, human flesh is exceedingly
indigestible and unwholesome!</p>

<p>If flesh-eating is as harmful as I have been endeavouring
to show, however, how comes it about that the
practice is so universal? And how did the practice
of flesh-eating originate, in the first place? These are
questions often asked of vegetarians, and there is a simple
answer to both of them. Flesh-eating is all but universal,
simply because people follow habit and custom
blindly, without thinking of their actions in the least—and,
strangely enough, on this most vital of all questions—food
and diet. On most other topics, people are
quite capable of thinking for themselves; but in this
question, they take not the slightest interest! So
long as the food <i>tastes</i> nice, that is all they care to think
about it; and the actual preparation of the food, and
all questions concerning its composition and combina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>165</span>tion
with other foods, they are content to leave to an
ignorant Chinaman or Irish cook, who knows as much
about the physiology and hygiene of dietetics as a cow
of the constitution of the moon. It is really amazing
that this should be so. It shows, of course, that people
have not really thought about their food in this light,
and realised the tremendous consequences of a false
and perverted diet, or the benefits of a simple and
nutritious one. Flesh-eating doubtless sprang into
existence ages ago, at a time when little or no other
food was to be obtained, and they had to live upon it
or starve. But we are not called upon to explain the
origin of meat-eating, as a matter of fact, any more
than we are the origin of alcohol-drinking. We must
take conditions as we find them, and endeavour to better
them, as best we can. It is certain that animals can
be taught to eat meat, quite contrary to their natural
dietetic habits—as indicated by their structure, and by
the unperverted dietetic habits of the rest of their
species. Thus, horses have been taught to eat meat
and drink beer; and, at certain seasons, the horses on
the coast of Norway are said to dash into the sea, and
endeavour to catch fishes in their mouths. Dogs and
cats can be taught to like alcoholic beverages of all
kinds; and similar perversions of taste in the animal
world might be cited by the score. If animals can thus
be trained to like foods and drinks of this character,
certainly man can be taught to like and to eat and drink
them also; and it is doubtless due to this fact that the
habit of meat-eating originated. Once perverted, the
appetite would have a tendency to stay perverted, by
reason of heredity; and in any case the environment
and education of the growing child would be quite
sufficient to engender the desire for meat—especially if
the individual were brought up under the notion that he
“cannot live” without meat, and that it is a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>166</span>
essential article of his diet! The medical profession is
to blame for much of this perverted reasoning, and the
public for blindly following it, without investigating
its doctrines for themselves. Only when this is done
can we hope for a widespread and radical reform—one
which will revolutionise diet and cookery and spread
health and harmony among the human race and the
animal kingdom—as well as restore man to a position
of elevated spiritual insight.</p>

<small>DAIRY PRODUCTS</small></h2></div>


<p>Coming, as these do, from the animal world—more or
less directly—they are eschewed by many strict vegetarians
and hygienists, as being open to all those
objections which might be urged against the use of flesh-meat,
only in a lesser degree. There is no doubt that
this is the only logical ground to assume, in this question,
and the one which many of us occupy from choice.
There can be no question, moreover, that man can
persist, and maintain all his faculties—physical and
mental—on a diet devoid of all these articles of food.
They are not open to any such serious objections as
are the flesh-meats, however; and are certainly to be
preferred to them. As found upon the market, they
are all more or less adulterated, unfortunately; and
preservatives, in the shape of salt, etc., introduced, to
prevent rapid decomposition. Eggs are also objectionable,
on the ground that they have been kept on ice,
as a rule, for long periods of time, before they are
offered for sale. But, even granting that these articles
of diet are fresh, and the best that can be procured,
there are still weighty objections to their use, as I can
readily show. Let us consider them a little more
fully, in turn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Milk.</i>—Milk is, of course, the natural food of man
for the first year or so of his life. This is no reason,
however, for supposing that man can continue to eat,
or rather drink, milk, for the rest of his life with impunity—especially
when this milk comes from the cow.
Milk as an article of diet has been highly praised by
many authorities. For example, in the pamphlet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>168</span>
issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Milk is peculiarly adapted for use as a food by man
for several reasons. It contains all the four classes of
nutriments—protein, fats, carbohydrates and mineral
matter—in more nearly the proper proportion to serve
as a complete food than any other food material, although
no one substance can furnish a complete food
for an adult.”</p></div>

<p>While this may be true, the differences that are
noted between human milk and cow’s milk are highly
important ones. It is to be remembered, in this connection,
that the blood and chemical composition of
the calf’s body are different from those of man;
and its natural food—milk—must consequently be
different, for that reason. The chemical composition
of cow’s milk is therefore not suited exactly for the
human being, and, in order to render it more nearly
ideal in composition, various other ingredients have
to be mixed with it, in order to make it more nearly
resemble the milk of the human species.</p>

<p>Mr Otto Carqué, writing in his “Folly of Meat
Eating,” said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Milk is a nutritious food which is best suited for
the new-born mammal. Only the infant’s digestive
apparatus is adapted for the proper digestion of milk;
his salivary glands are not yet developed and his
alimentary canal is almost a straight tube, quite
different from that of the adult. There is a little bulge
in the tube, from which the stomach gradually develops,
and during this time very little gastric juice is formed.
When milk enters the stomach of an infant it goes
easily through and down into the intestines where it
can be digested. In the stomach of the adult, which
is of different shape and secretes more acid gastric juice,
milk forms large, tough curds which are not easily
digested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>169</span></p>

<p>”<i>Cow’s milk is a splendid food for calves, but it cannot
be recommended very well for human beings.</i> The natural
food-supply of the infant—mother’s milk—forms very
small, soft curds which are easily broken up and digested.
They are entirely different from the curds
formed by cow’s milk which are tough and only adapted
to the four-stomach digestive apparatus of the calf.
An exclusive diet of milk may often increase the weight
of a person, but this is due to its large percentage of
water, while it does not contain enough organic salt
for the adult who needs a larger percentage of iron,
sulphur and silicon in his food.</p>

<p>“Cow’s milk is sometimes diluted with water and
sweetened with refined sugar to serve as food for
children. Warning cannot be sounded often enough
against this injurious practice of diminishing the percentage
of organic salts in the milk, a circumstance
which at once interferes with the proper oxidation and
circulation of the blood, giving rise to a larger number
of infantile diseases. <i>Refined sugar</i> is entirely deficient
in mineral matter and therefore always injurious to
health.”</p></div>

<p>But there is a far greater danger in milk than any
we have so far considered. I refer to the unhealthy
condition of cows. Bovine tuberculosis and other
diseases are very prevalent among cows of all sorts—far
more so than is usually believed. E. F. Brush, M.D.,
in his book, “Human and Bovine Tuberculosis,” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My occupation brings me into close contact with
dairy cattle, and I have therefore been compelled to
devote my attention to the diseases afflicting dairy
stock, and that there is a large number of dairy cows
afflicted with tuberculosis I can affirm; that there has
never been any attempt to exterminate the disease is a
fact of which I am also cognisant.... I have been
told by inspectors of the Bureau of Animal Industry
that a much larger percentage of our cows are affected
than is the case in England. Indeed, among the
thoroughbred Jerseys in the Northern states, twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>170</span>
per cent. are affected, as I have been told by Professor
R. A. McLean, chief of this district from the bureau.”</p></div>

<p>And in his work on “Milk,” this author says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Diseases may be conveyed by milk taken from an
animal suffering from disease, or by milk contaminated
in a dairy, or by contact with diseased or affected
persons.”</p></div>

<p>These words were written some years ago, and it is
probably true that conditions have somewhat improved
since that time; but there can be no question that a
large number of diseased cattle still exist and supply
milk to the various cities—their standard being kept
somewhat low by continued in-and-in breeding. And
it must not be overlooked, in this connection, that no
matter if the animal be perfectly healthy, the milk
partakes of the nature and general character and
composition of the animal’s body; and while this may
not be actually diseased, it is doubtless in a more or
less depraved condition—as are practically all domesticated
animals, particularly the cow—during the confined
period of winter. And the milk, being a secretion,
naturally takes on the conditions of the body of
the animal—as would any other secretion.</p>

<p>Indeed, Professor L. B. Arnold, an excellent authority
on all dairy matters, says:</p>

<p>
“Milk is the scavenger of the cow’s body.”<br />
</p>

<p>But now suppose we have the best of milk, from
perfectly healthy cows, there would still remain several
objections to its use. In all conditions of torpor of the
liver, or in all dyspeptic conditions, or whenever there
is a tendency towards biliousness, milk is sure to cause
distress, being unsuited to the organism. Milk contains
a large percentage of liquid (upwards of 90 per cent.)
to a very small percentage of solid; and while this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>171</span>
proportionate percentage is right for the body of the
babe, it is not suited for that of the adult. He should
eat more solid food, and, if necessary, drink water
separately.</p>

<p>Milk contains a large percentage of fat, and but a
small percentage of proteid and mineral salts, and the
adult can usually balance his diet better by leaving out
milk and by ingesting a smaller bulk of more nutritious
food material, which he is able to assimilate, but which
the babe cannot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Cream</i>, if used to the same extent as milk, would
doubtless be far more injurious. Those who partake
of large quantities of cream usually become bilious,
as is evidenced by the colour of the complexion, the
whites of the eyes, blotches and eruptions which appear
upon the skin, etc. But, taken in the very limited
quantity that it usually is, it is probably less harmful
than milk, on that account. Both milk and cream, if
taken at all, should be considered a food rather than
a drink, and should be thoroughly masticated before
being swallowed—since important chemical changes
take place in the mouth, and the milk is also prevented
from curdling in the excessively large clots that would
form, were milk drunk in quantity, without being
separated in the mouth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Butter.</i>—If we dispense with milk—that is, leave it to
the calf, for whom nature intended it—there will, of
necessity, be no butter; and, from a sanitary point of
view, the absence of it would perhaps be no great loss,
it being by no means as wholesome an article of diet as
either milk or cream. Like other oils, it is, to a degree,
indigestible; not that it gives “a pain in the stomach,”
as a general thing, but it does not enter into those vital
changes which are necessary to convert food into chyle
proper. It mixes with the pancreatic juice in the form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>172</span>
of an emulsion, simply, and goes into the blood in that
crude condition; and being carried through the system
by the capillaries, it is deposited <i>as fat</i> in the various
tissues, and largely in the skin. From the very nature
of its constituents, butter has but little nutritive value
It usually contains 3 to 5 per cent. of casein (due to
the presence of the milk) and about twice that amount
of water; the other substances are oils, fixed and
volatile. These readily decompose upon exposure to
the atmosphere, and butyric and other fat acids are
set free.</p>

<p>Persons who live largely upon butter emit a strong
odour from the skin, very perceptible to those who do
not use animal foods. The salt which has to be mixed
with it to make it “keep” is not, to the hygienist, a
desirable addition, for reasons which will be hereafter
stated. Pereira says: “Fixed oil or fat is more difficult
of digestion and more obnoxious to the stomach
than any other alimentary principle.” Indeed, in some
more or less obvious or concealed form, I believe it will
be found the offending ingredient in nine-tenths of the
dishes which disturb weak stomachs. Many dyspeptics,
who have religiously avoided the use of fat in its obvious
or ordinary state (as fat meat, marrow, butter, and oil)
unwittingly employ it in some more concealed form,
and, as I have frequently witnessed, have suffered therefrom.
Such individuals should eschew the yolks of eggs,
livers (of quadrupeds, poultry and fish) and brains, all
of which abound in oily matter. Milk, and especially
cream, disagree with many persons, or, as they term it,
“lies heavy on the stomach,” in consequence of the
butter it contains. Rich cheese, likewise, contains
butter, and on that account is apt to disturb the
stomach.</p>

<p>Schlickeysen, in speaking of the use of butter, eggs,
and cheese, remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>173</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These cause an excess of fat in the system, and an
offensive, slimy, condition of the mucous secretions of
the mouth and nose, quite apparent to those who, contrary
to their usual habit, eat them. Their effects are
apparent also in eruptions upon the skin, especially
upon the face.”</p></div>


<p><i>Eggs.</i>—Eggs are pretty generally conceded to be a
“bilious diet”; and if eaten freely at each meal for
a few weeks, the whites of the eyes usually show the
presence of bile. They contain an excess of sulphur.
The albumen (whites of the eggs) cooked soft, would be
less objectionable than the yolks, which contain about
30 per cent. of oil. If eggs are eaten they should be
fresh, their use not too frequent, and confined to cool
weather. The fowls should be allowed plenty of clean
territory to run over, and an abundance of fresh pure
water, pure air, and good grains. Unfortunately, the
habits of the bird are not the cleanest; it will pick up
and eat almost anything that comes in its way. This
is why country eggs and country fowl (provided there are
good and healthful surroundings) are always to be
preferred. In towns or cities the chickens are necessarily
confined to the house and yard; whereas in the
country they have access to the open fields, and feed
largely on grains.</p>

<p>Persons who are subject to torpor of the liver would
do well to refrain from the use of either eggs or butter;
and those who have sound livers—and desire to keep
them so—can take a hint!</p>

<p>A great many vegetarians are strong advocates of
dairy products, and particularly eggs. They claim,
rightly enough, that they contain a large amount of
proteid, and hence are valuable meat substitutes. But
this same proteid can be obtained from nuts and vegetables,
as we have seen—without the necessity of resorting
to eggs in order to secure it. From the ethical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>174</span>
point of view, there is no excuse whatever for the eating
of eggs; and there are many objections to their use on
purely hygienic grounds. It is remarkable, in this connection,
to find so strong a belief in egg-eating, when we
take into account the fact that these eggs are all intended
to be chickens by nature, and we are really eating
chickens <i>in embryo</i>—a very disagreeable thought, when
we come to consider it. All other eggs—swallow’s eggs,
ostrich’s eggs, robin’s eggs, etc.—we think of as existing
only for the purpose of bringing into the world little
swallows or ostriches or robins: but the hen’s egg we
consider, for some mysterious reason or other, laid for our
especial benefit—as a suitable and even necessary food!
It is really remarkable that such curious ideas should
have originated in the human mind. Doubtless they
originated in the days of savagery, when but little else
could be obtained for food, but which culture and
modern ideals should have outgrown long ago.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Cheese.</i>—“The fresh curd of milk is perfectly wholesome,
and pot cheese is also a practically harmless article
of diet. Green cheese is not very objectionable, but
old, strong cheese, is one of the most injurious and indigestible
things in existence. It is also one of the
most constipating articles of food that can be found.
It is a common fancy among medical men, and a common
whim among the people, that old, strong, rank cheese,
though itself very indigestible, stimulates the stomach
to digest other things. Hence almost all the medico-dietetic
works quote the old adage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Cheese is a mity elf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Digesting all things but itself.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There is more poetry than truth in the doggerel
quoted. Old cheese occasionally undergoes spontaneous
decomposition, during which process acrid and
poisonous elements are developed, as is frequently
the case with bacon and sausages.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>175</span></p>
<p>Although cheese is, in one sense, a valuable article of
diet, in that it contains a large percentage of fat and
proteid, it is nevertheless objectionable in many ways.
The fact that it is derived from milk, and hence indirectly
from the animal world, necessitates the same
objections to its use as have been raised against all
the other animal products. The same proteid may be
obtained from nuts and purely vegetable substances,
without the injurious admixture of possible toxic
materials, impurities, and adulterants. In this connection
it may be added that the common salt which is
generally introduced into cheese in order to preserve it,
renders it an unhygienic article of diet; and hence it is
to be debarred, since other substances (containing the
same amount of proteid, etc.) can be obtained, in which
these mineral ingredients are lacking.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>176</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />

<small>VEGETABLES</small></h2></div>


<p><i>Peas, Beans, Lentils, etc.</i>—It can be seen by referring
to the tables of foods that these articles of diet contain
a large amount of proteid, and are consequently good
substitutes for meat; and, if the ordinary vegetarian
diet be adhered to, they should form the staple foods in
place of the meat that has been omitted. They are very
hearty articles of diet, however, and contain a large
amount of proteid in a concentrated form, and for that
reason should be eaten in the winter months, if at all.
These articles of food, moreover, all contain a certain
percentage of uric acid-forming materials, and for this
reason should be avoided whenever possible. Dr Haig,
throughout his writings, has argued very strongly against
the legumes as food for man, and has shown that an
excessive consumption of such foods tends to create
uric acid—and results in the evil consequences which
follow from its presence, whenever eaten in large quantities.
He recommends in their place nuts, cheese, and
milk. Cheese and milk we have already considered,
and the value of nuts we shall ascertain when we come
to the chapter on the fruitarian diet. On the whole,
then, it cannot be said that peas, beans, and lentils are
desirable articles of food, whenever they can be avoided.
Their chief value consists in the amount of proteid they
contain, and this can be supplied by nuts, as we have
seen, and shall see further. In addition to this, we now
know that large amounts of proteid are not required
by the system, and are detrimental rather than beneficial
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>177</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the early spring,” says Dr Dodds, in her “Health
in the Household,” p. 40, “when we have grown tired
of ‘last year’s leavings,’ the tender vegetables fill our
markets, and delight our eyes in glad anticipation of a
change in the repast. The young beets, the spinach,
and asparagus, the early cauliflower, and even the
lettuce and onions have charms for us then. As summer
draws nigh, the varieties of choice vegetables multiply,
giving us green peas, tomatoes, string beans, summer
squashes, and an almost endless variety of products.
Then come the autumn days, and with them the great
lima beans, the hubbard squashes, and the sweet
potatoes. Nor does the supply fail us when winter
approaches; there are still turnips, potatoes, cabbage,
winter squashes, and other good things. Really it is
little less than wonderful what varieties of vegetable
products there are even in a single latitude of climate.”</p></div>

<p>Although vegetables are capable of supporting life,
and contain many of the nutritious properties most
necessary for bodily sustenance, there are, nevertheless,
objections to be raised against almost every one of
these foods. Personally, I do not believe that they are
suitable articles of diet for the human race. When we
come to the chapter on the fruitarian diet, I shall endeavour
to show that fruits and nuts in their uncooked,
primitive form, are the suitable and proper diet for
mankind; and I believe that, although he can subsist
upon vegetables, and even maintain a certain degree of
health upon the ordinary vegetarian diet, I do not think
that it begins to compare in excellence with the fruitarian
or raw-food diet. Throughout this book, I have
been used to speaking of “vegetarian” as opposed to
a “mixed” diet—including meat—and I certainly think
it preferable to that generally followed; but the diet
I would advocate is as far superior to the ordinary vegetarian
diet as <i>that</i> is superior to the mixed diet. It
consists almost exclusively of fruits and nuts. The
fruitarian diet, then, is, in my estimation, the ideal diet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>178</span>
and the reasons for this I shall endeavour to give in
full in Chapter XII.</p>

<p>All vegetables, to be rendered fit articles for human
food, must be <i>cooked</i>, in the first place, and this fact alone
renders the ordinary vegetarian diet less nutritious
and less wholesome than the fruitarian or raw-food
diet. With few exceptions, moreover, the vegetables
contain but little nutritive matter. Those which <i>do</i>
contain a high percentage of proteid are open to the
same objections as were raised against meat—namely,
that they create uric acid. But the majority of vegetables
supply nothing that cannot be derived in simpler
and in better form from the fruit and nut dietary; and
they contain, moreover, a large percentage of indigestible
and fibrous material—refuse—from which the other
foods are free. A brief glance at each of the vegetables
individually will confirm this. <i>Potatoes</i> are nearly all
starch; they contain practically no proteid, fats, or
mineral substances of value, and are, generally speaking,
constipating articles of food. The objections to <i>peas</i>,
<i>beans</i> and <i>lentils</i> we have discussed. <i>Asparagus</i>,
<i>spinach</i>, and similar vegetables contain but little nutriment,
and much waste, and on the whole can be considered
little better than weeds. <i>Cabbages</i> of various
sorts, <i>brussels sprouts</i>, <i>cauliflower</i>, <i>broccoli</i>, etc., are also
open to these objections. They contain a large amount
of fibrous, indigestible matter, with but a small amount
of nutriment. Cabbage, eaten raw, is not such a bad
article of diet, but cooked in the way in which it usually
is, the iron, and its valuable salts, pass into the water
in which it is cooked—so that there is, in one sense, more
nutriment in the water than there is in the mere
“skeleton” that is left, and which we eat! <i>Onions</i>,
<i>leeks</i>, and <i>garlics</i> may have their uses in certain diseases,
when eaten raw, but they would doubtless lose these
properties when cooked, and many persons cannot eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>179</span>
them. They are very strong articles of food, and it is
doubtful if they are intended for human aliment at all.
<i>Turnips</i> and <i>parsnips</i> consist almost entirely of water,
and are practically valueless as food. They contain a
very small percentage of carbohydrates, but they are
spongy and fibrous, and frequently hard to digest.
The same objections would apply more or less to <i>carrots</i>,
<i>beetroots</i>, and <i>artichokes</i>. <i>Mushrooms</i> should by all
means be avoided. They are exceedingly indigestible,
in a large number of cases, and there is, in addition,
a great danger of becoming poisoned by toadstools, or
other fungi. <i>Corn</i> is an exceedingly indigestible food—especially
if insufficiently masticated, as it invariably is.
The proteid it contains can be supplied in many other
more wholesome foods. <i>Celery</i> consists almost entirely
of fibre, and cannot rightly be considered as suitable for
human food. <i>Endives</i>, <i>cresses</i>, <i>capers</i>, <i>dandelions</i>,
<i>radishes</i>, etc., are all weeds, and, if uncultivated, would
be totally unfit for the human stomach. <i>Lettuce</i> contains
a certain amount of opium; and <i>cucumber</i> is widely
known for its great indigestibility.</p>

<p>Summing up the nutritive values of these various
vegetables, then, we can fairly say that none of them
contain the essential properties suitable for human food.
The majority of them are indigestible and are, by their
innate composition, improper foods for the human race.
All the nutritive materials which they contain can be
supplied in a purer and better form by the various
fruits and nuts, while the tough, fibrous nature of
most of the vegetables necessitates an enormous outlay
of the energy of digestion, which should be conserved
and utilised for other and better purposes. The fact,
further, that these various food-stuffs have to be
cooked in order to render them palatable and edible,
is another objection to their use. Even Dr Tibbles,
who strongly insists on the value of vegetables as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>180</span>
human food, is forced to write in his “Food and
Hygiene,” p. 193:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Persons in robust health with healthy stomachs,
and leading active lives may eat all kinds of vegetables,
however cooked, without injury, except when they are
taken in excess.... Those who are only able to
digest vegetables, especially green vegetables, with
difficulty should have them in the form of consommé
or purée. In their preparation, the cooked vegetable
is minced and pounded in a mortar until it is reduced
to a pulp, and then rubbed through a hair sieve to remove
skin and rough fibres.”</p></div>

<p>In other words, it is practically admitted that vegetables
are hard to digest at all times, and that as
soon as the energy of digestion is lowered, this fact
is immediately apparent! This is evident from the
directions that are given to remove the skin and tough
fibres. On the fruitarian diet none of these objections
would be encountered—the bland, soothing, cooling,
antiseptic properties of the fruit juices being readily
seen, and practically never cause indigestion, no
matter how enfeebled it may be, or how sick the patient—provided
eating be possible at all—and provided
that they do not contain an excess of acids and other
substances injurious to the body in its then state of
health. Vegetables are, further, a very <i>bulky</i> food,
and for this reason, also, I consider them objectionable.</p>

<small>CEREALS</small></h2></div>


<p>There is much dispute as to the relative value of
wheat, and other cereal foods, as articles of diet. Numbers
of authors contend that they are in very truth
the “staff of life ”; others, on the contrary, maintain
that they are totally unsuited for human food, and that
it would be far better for the human race if cereals
of all kinds were replaced by other articles of food,
containing somewhat similar constituents. We shall
examine these opposite opinions a little later on. Let
us first of all consider these foods, their functions, and
how far they may be supported to nourish the body and
maintain the health. Let us take first of all <i>wheat</i>.
The five outer layers of the bran contain very little
except cellulose—a woody, fibrous substance, forming
the cell walls. When burned, the ash of bran is found
to contain a large proportion of phosphoric acid,
potash, and a small amount of other mineral matters.
The cereal layer is, of all parts of the grain, the richest
in nitrogenous substances—the chief of which is the
creatine, from which it takes its name. Gluten is one
of the most important constituents of the wheat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is separated from the grain, as
is well known, and adheres to the husk, when this is
removed; and for this reason “superfine” white flour
contains but very little nutriment, and a large quantity
of starch—a very constipating food and one which
necessitates a large amount of vital expenditure when
converting it into bodily tissue. As is well known, all
starch must go through several processes or stages of
digestion before it can be used by the system. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>182</span>
body can never use starch <i>as starch</i>. It must be
converted into glucose sugar before the body can make
use of or appropriate it. It must first of all be converted
into various substances—dextrose, maltose, etc.—before
it is finally transformed into glucose—in which
form the body can utilise it. <i>Starch, then, must be
converted into sugar (glucose) before the body can use
it</i>; and must be transformed into this substance at
the expense of the bodily energy, of which a great
amount has to be expended in these varied processes
of conversion. Now, this being the case, <i>why would
it not be easier and better for us to eat those foods that
supply this glucose or grape-sugar direct</i>—without
necessitating any of these energy-wasting transformations?
Were we to take this grape-sugar directly into
the system (stomach) as an article of food, we should
thereby save all the energy of digestion, which would
otherwise be wasted in useless processes of conversion.
There can be no valid reason why this should not be
the case.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And, since fruits contain this very grape-sugar
in a free and natural state, it becomes obvious
that we can obtain from fruits all that we derive from
grains and cereals (with the exception of proteid matter,
which we can get from nuts) and in a far better state—because
more appropriable by the system. I am
strongly convinced that nothing is to be derived from
wheat or similar grains and cereals that cannot be
derived equally well or better from fruits and nuts of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>183</span>various kinds. And this applies to all other grains—rye,
barley, oats, etc.—as well as to wheat. They are
all objectionable for the same reason; and a properly
balanced diet of fruits and nuts is superior to any diet
of grains and cereals.</p>

<p>It is well known that toast is more wholesome than
ordinary bread: it is given to invalids, when bread is
debarred. The reason for this—which comparatively
few persons know—is that a portion of the starch
contained in the flour is converted into dextrine,
by this process of toasting. In this manner, a portion
of the original starch contained in the bread is “predigested,”
and hence saves the vital energies so much
tax—when it comes to the digestion of this starch. But
would it not be better to give the patient fruits, in which
<i>all</i> these processes of conversion have already been performed
by nature—and hence save far more of the bodily
energies than even the giving of toast? It must be
remembered that starch contains nothing that is useful
to the system except this grape-sugar, which can also
be obtained from fruits of all kinds, in a natural and
appropriable form. This being so, why not give fruits
in the first place—thus saving all this useless expenditure
of energy? There is also the additional argument
that fruits of all kinds are cleansing and slightly laxative—instead
of being constipating—and have also
powerful germicidal properties. However, I shall
consider this question more at length in the chapter
devoted to the fruitarian diet.</p>

<p>Many writers upon the subject of dietetics are very
laudatory of wheat and other cereal foods. Dr Tibbles,
indeed, in his “Food and Hygiene,” p. 229, says that
“so large a part do they fulfil in domestic preparations
that it is almost safe to say that if the entire crop of
cereals failed for one year nearly 90 per cent. of the
inhabitants of the earth would die”! This might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>184</span>
true in a certain sense, for there would be no article of
food to take the place of the cereals destroyed; but if
nuts and fruits had been cultivated instead, it would be
found that all the cereals could be dispensed with easily
enough, and that none of the inhabitants would die;
but, on the contrary, that they would retain a high
degree of health—far higher than they now possess.</p>

<p>If the whole wheat, containing all the grain—the
nutritious gluten as well as the (comparatively speaking)
innutritious starch—were supplied to the body,
there would be far less objection to the use of grains
and cereals; but as a matter of fact, this is rarely
the case, and only health-reformers insist upon having
bread made of whole wheat flour or gluten bread.
The majority eat bread made of white, “superfine”
flour—flour totally divested of its nutritious elements.
Such flour contains none of the valuable salts which the
whole grain contains; it is devoid of the proteid matter;
it is constipating, and in other ways objectionable.
And a practical proof of the correctness of this position
is afforded by the fact that dogs, fed by Magendie upon
superfine white flour, <i>all died</i>; while those dogs which
were fed upon whole-wheat flour lived and retained their
health. Such an experiment is worth any amount of
theorising, for or against.</p>

<p>Dr S. Rowbatham, writing some years ago on this
subject, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bread [from wheaten flour], when considered in
reference to the amount of nutritious matter it contains,
may with justice be called the staff of life; but
in regard to the amount of earthy matter, we may with
equal justice pronounce it the staff of death.... It is
quite right to suppose that nutritious food is necessary
to support and strengthen the fœtus; but the nutritious
and the solid earthy matter in food are very different
substances. Wheaten flour, on account of its containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>185</span>
so much earthy matter, is the most dangerous article
a female can live upon, when pregnant. The other
grains are bad enough, but better than wheat....
Persons of a dull, cadaverous appearance, with harsh
rough skins, who are thin and bony and continually
troubled with some complaint or other, I have always
found to be greatly attached to a food of a solid, earthy
nature, such as bread, puddings, pies, tarts, cakes,
and flour preparations in general.... Heavy, clumsy
persons, whose movements—when they do move—are
stiff and awkward are always great consumers of solid
food, especially of bread and pastry of all kinds....
Among children and young persons too, it may be
seen that the dull, heavy, ill-tempered ones are mostly
great consumers of solid grain foods; while the more
active and lively are less anxious for food of a solid
character, but mostly fond of light, fluid, saccharine
substances.... These facts and many others which
could be advanced, all tend to support and prove the
position that food and drink alone are the source of the
calcareous earthy matter which is generally deposited
in the body, and which by degrees brings on a state
of induration, rigidity and consequent decreptitude—which
ends in a total cessation of consciousness, or
death. We have seen that different kinds of food
and drink contain these earthy elements in different
proportions; and we cannot avoid the conclusion that
the more we subsist upon such articles as contain the
greatest amount, the sooner shall we choke up and die;
and the more we live upon such substances as are comparatively
free, the longer will health, activity and life
continue.”</p></div>

<p>In the twenty-second and twenty-third chapters of
the third book of Herodotus, describing a visit of some
Persian ambassadors to the long-lived Ethiopians
(Macrobii), the Ethiopians asked what the Persian
king was wont to eat, and to what age the longest-lived
Persians had been known to attain. They told
him that the king ate bread, and described the nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>186</span>
of wheat—adding that eighty years was the longest
term of man’s life among the Persians. Hereat, he
remarked: “It did not surprise him, if they fed on
<i>dirt</i> [bread] that they died so soon! Indeed he was
sure that they never would have lived so long as eighty
years, except for the refreshment that they got from
that drink [meaning the wine], wherein he confessed
that Persians surpassed the Ethiopians.”</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be apparent why
I do not consider grains and cereals valuable articles
of food—far less the indispensable articles they are
usually supposed to be. As generally purchased, these
flours and grains are innutritious, clogging, and
particularly unwholesome articles of food; but even
at their best, and taking the whole grain, they contain
nothing that cannot be supplied in a better state by
an exclusive fruit and nut diet. We must remember
Magendie’s experiments on dogs. One died in forty
days, while fed upon fine wheat and flour, while another
dog, fed upon brown bread, lived without any disturbance,
and in good health. This should show us conclusively
that the fine flour upon the market—the flour
invariably consumed—is practically useless as food;
but since all the nutritive properties of grains may be
derived in a better form from fruits, nuts, etc., the
only remaining reason for eating grains and cereals
vanishes.</p>

<p>We now come to consider the various “food accessories,”
as they are called—meaning the various condiments,
etc., which go to make unappetising food palatable!
If the food were natural to the organism, it should need
no such appetisers: but I let that pass. Let us consider
the relative values of these articles of diet, and
see how far each of them may be considered as necessary
and beneficial to the human organism. I shall begin
with the one in most common use, and one that the
majority think they cannot live without—salt!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Salt.</i>—The arguments in favour of salt-eating, as
found in the books, may be summarised thus:</p>

<p>1. It is natural to man, the habit being universal.</p>

<p>2. It is necessary to life. Human beings deprived
of it die.</p>

<p>3. Wild and domestic animals crave and seek it.</p>

<p>4. It is an invariable constituent of the solids and
fluids of the body; hence it must be supplied.</p>

<p>5. Cattle, when given it, increase greatly in weight,
so that if not itself food, it may take the place of food
by making it “go further.”</p>

<p>6. It retards the waste of the system, and in this way
may prolong life.</p>

<p>7. It is essential to promote the secretion and flow of
saliva and bile.</p>

<p>8. It promotes appetite by rendering the food more
palatable.</p>

<p>The first three of the above propositions constitute
what may be styled the prescriptive or old-fashioned
argument. The next four, grouped together, are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>188</span>
chemical theory of the value of salt, and are of more
recent origin. The last, though seldom advanced as a
scientific reason, partakes of the character of science as
well as of tradition.</p>

<p>In regard to No. 1, let us see how far it is borne out.
To destroy logically the value of the proposition it
would only be necessary to establish the case of a single
individual who does not and has not used salt—raw
salt—in his food. The universality, that which it rests
upon, would then be broken. We ought not to be
content with that, however. I think it would not be
difficult to show that there are whole nations and tribes
of people who do not eat salt. I am told by an Italian,
who has lived among them, that the Algerians do not.
I was myself informed, while in that region, that the
Indian tribes inhabiting the banks of the Columbia River
and Puget Sound do not. It is noteworthy also that
those tribes are among the most peaceful, intelligent
and industrious tribes in North America, and are of
fine personal appearance. I think there is little doubt
that the inhabitants of the islands of the Pacific Ocean
lived from a period of vast antiquity, until their discovery
by Europeans, without putting salt crystals
on their food. It has continually happened that hunters,
tourists, soldiers and explorers have been left for
weeks, months and years without a supply of salt, by
accident or otherwise, and have survived without
apparent injury. Finally, there are many persons
in the United States who have voluntarily abandoned
the use of salt for periods ranging from one to twenty
years (and for aught I know longer), not only without
injury but with increased health, strength and activity.
So far from being natural to man, the instincts of
children, especially when born free from an inherited
bias in its favour, go to show by their rejection of it
that it is <i>un</i>natural. Like the taste for coffee, tea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>189</span>
and various seasonings, it is an acquired one. Few if
any children do not prefer unsalted food.</p>

<p>It should not be overlooked that the manufacture and
distribution of salt as an article of commerce is a thing
of history, and has attained its enormous dimensions
within the past century and a half. It is inconceivable
that in past times the population of the world, made up
as it was largely of pastoral and nomadic people inhabiting
the interior of the great continents, should have
supplied themselves with salt as an ingredient of food,
as we do. The omission of any mention of it in the
older chronicles and even among the more perfect
records of the classics, except at the luxurious tables
of the rich, goes to confirm this supposition.</p>

<p>Propositions Nos. 2 and 3 are of the same character,
and have a like origin. It is discouraging to discover how
little thorough sifting of beliefs there is among mankind—especially
concerning matters of such primary importance
as their daily diet—a neglect for which their hair-splitting
casuistry on topics of faith and morals in no way
atones. The foundation of the notion that men die
when deprived of salt (and the inference therefrom that
it is because of it), so far as I have been able to trace it,
rests on an experience related in the older works on
physiology, and copied with childlike confidence into the
later ones, to the effect that, more than one hundred
years ago, during the wars waged by England on the
Continent, several thousand British soldiers, being shut
up as prisoners of war in the low countries—at the
Hague, I believe—and after an incarceration of many
months, all died of disease, induced, it is stated, by being
deprived of salt! The same cry, it will be remembered,
has been charged to modern nations in more recent
wars, and notably during the American Civil War, when
the mortality was so great in the southern prisons. It
needs no great natural acumen nor book learning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>190</span>
discover that there are other and far more potent disease-inducing
causes at work to account for the dreadful
mortality—even in these days of superior civilisation
and greater humanity. Observation satisfies me that
inattention to ordinary sanitary precautions—partly
incident to confinement and partly to the rooted superstition
in the minds of those who had charge of them,
that disease is a something to be fought out with specific
medicines after it has appeared, rather than prevented
from making its appearance—will abundantly reconcile
the facts, if they be facts; and in this I am confirmed
by a comparison of the appalling ratio of mortality
recorded in some of the most famed of London and Paris
hospitals, where gangrene and fevers alone did their
deadly work, in spite of the attentions of doctors, without
appreciable aid from those inevitable attendants of
war-prisons—homesickness, filth and bad diet. Such
evidence as this would hardly be received in a trial for
larceny; and yet it is solemnly repeated generation
after generation by those who should be teachers of
teachers.</p>

<p>The third proposition, in regard to the wild and domestic
animals, is, like the preceding, not formidable
when examined. I have diligently inquired of old
hunters and pioneers for confirmation of the story that
deer and buffalo are in the habit of visiting regularly the
salt springs or “licks,” in order to eat the salt. I have
not been able to find one who has ever seen the licking
process himself. There is reason to believe that hunters
do take their positions at certain brine-springs to find
their game, and that the deer at certain seasons of the
year resort to them—precisely why is not determined.
Nothing of the kind is now claimed of the buffalo;
that is a tradition. But suppose it were all true, as
claimed, does that justify man in sprinkling the solid
residue of the brine on his food? Is there not here too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>191</span>
lofty a structure upon too slight a foundation? It is
notorious that all the salt springs hold in solution (sometimes
found encrusted on their sides) large amounts of
lime, sulphur, iron, and commonly other ingredients.</p>

<p>The very purest of our table salts of commerce contain
from 2 to 4 per cent. of the sulphate of lime, after
they are supposed to have been purified and larger
amounts of it removed. May it not be that at certain
seasons, as in the winter when the herbage is covered by
snow, or during pregnancy, when the fœtus requires it,
the deer (or buffalo, if you will) repair to these spots
instinctively for that which nature denies them at the
time? We know that cows on a scant pasture, at such
times, will chew and partly dissolve an old bone; yet
it would be equally reasonable to put ground bones on
our food as an inference from this trait; indeed, more
so, as the latter is an admitted fact of everyday occurrence,
while the other is somewhat in doubt; and besides
the economy of lime in the system is patent.</p>

<p>In regard to domestic animals we are on more solid
ground; only it is constantly necessary to remember
that we are dealing with creatures domesticated and
subdued in some degree to the will of man. It is a
common notion that salt is necessary to the well-being,
if not the preservation, of horses and horned cattle. It
is, I am persuaded, a great mistake. In the first place,
although it is undoubtedly true that some domestic
cattle will eat salt, and follow impatiently to get it, it
is not true of wild cattle. I am assured by many of the
great herders in Texas, Colorado and California, that the
native cattle are not fed salt, never see it, and will not
eat it if offered. Of course it is a transparent absurdity
that salt could be hauled hundreds of miles to feed these
great inland herds; and it is not done, as is supposed.
They derive salt enough from the grass of the plains to
supply nature’s demand, if any there be. This, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>192</span>
furnishes any analogy at all, points to the food itself
as the true source of supply for the human species.</p>

<p>But in regard to the craving of horses and cows kept
within fences, enclosures and buildings, it is susceptible
of proof, and has been proved many times, that it is an
artificial and not a natural appetite. I have seen both
horses and cows which will not eat salt if offered to
them. The parents, when the supply was cut off, did
not suffer perceptibly, and in a short time unlearned
the habit. Neither the old ones nor their progeny will
touch it now. I have not space here to enter into the
question of the great injury done to the health, and
consequently to the wholesomeness of the flesh of both
improved and native or Texas varieties of cattle, by
the pernicious practice of thrusting salt into their
food, while preparing for, or on the way to, market, in
order that the weight may be increased. It is worth
the while of the State to institute an inquiry to see if this
be not one of the provoking causes of the cattle diseases,
and rinderpests of America and Europe.</p>

<p>The tendency in the human mind—the more so with
the untrained intellect—to find the class of facts it is
seeking for, and to overlook or ignore the class which
makes against its preconceived notion or desire, is
always to be guarded against. It is a little singular
that the advocates of the salt habit should have selected
the one or two species of wild animals, and the two or
three allied species or varieties under domestication
which do or can be made to eat salt, while the vastly
greater number of both classes of animals which do
not and cannot be made to, are overlooked. True
enough, a hungry cow will eat what is called “salt hay,”
whereon the brine from the sea has crystallised, but invariably
the same cow will turn from it to good well-cured
meadow hay. Hunger is a terrible temptation,
hence many of our animals (and the same is true of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>193</span>
children) acquire their taste for salt by its mixture with
their food; and a reprehensible practice has begun of
mixing salt, or lime, with the new hay in the stack in
order to “cure” it—that is, to prevent its decay by excess
of moisture—on the theory that the hay is improved
thereby. Surely no argument can properly be drawn
from appetites so engendered. On the same principle
might we sprinkle sawdust with a horse’s oats, because,
if kept up, he will gnaw away the boards within reach.
For this, by the way, there are good physiological
reasons.</p>

<p>Look, however, at the other side of the argument as
drawn from the lower animals. How numerous are
they by whom salt is rejected or to whom it is hurtful?
The whole of the birds avoid salt. It is fatal to chickens
and tame birds, as every housewife knows. Indeed,
there is strong ground for supposing that much of what
is called “chicken cholera,” “gapes,” and the like,
is in part due to the presence of salt—not always in
minute quantities—in the food taken from the table.
Wild birds have no such epidemic diseases affecting the
mucous linings of their organs. It is also fatal to the
hog, that foulest and hardiest of omnivora, which, out
of some stress of famine, or from its peculiar prolificacy,
men have been led to dwell with and propagate as a
food supply. I believe it is well ascertained that when
hogs get a moderate amount of brine, or pickled salt
meat, it is impossible to save them. To vary the phrase a
little: that which will make a hog sick cannot, <i>prima
facie</i>, be good food for his owner. Of all the range of
wild animals, clean or unclean, it is yet to be shown
that a single one eats salt voluntarily as food. Why
should man be the exception?</p>

<p>It is further claimed that salt is a necessary constituent
of the diet, for the reason that, when the body is
examined, <i>post-mortem</i>, a certain amount of salt is found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>194</span>
therein. From this it is argued that salt is therefore
necessary to the human body! It is queer logic. Were
opium or nicotine found in the body of the dead man,
would it be argued that <i>therefore</i> opium or nicotine were
necessary to the body in health? Yet the argument is
just as logical, and the conclusion just as warranted.</p>

<p>All that can be urged, logically, is that salt is a necessary
article of diet; and that, no one would deny.
Certainly I would not. But I must insist that this salt
can be supplied to the body in its <i>organic</i> form—just as
any other salt can. It is contained in fruits and vegetables,
together with other salts: why not eat it in
that way, just as we eat those other salts? To be sure,
we need common salt, just as we need iron, and potash,
and sulphur, and lime, and other mineral salts; but
no one thinks of sprinkling lime and potash and iron
filings over his food, just the same! There is no more
reason why we should sprinkle sodium chloride, or
common salt, over our food, than there is why we should
sprinkle any of these other salts. Both are equally
mineral elements: both are inorganic substances; and
hence both are equally unusable by the system. Salt
can have no more effect upon the economy than iron
filings can; and there is no more reason for taking the
one into the system in this crude form than there is for
taking the other. Only habit and prejudice sustain
the custom.</p>

<p>It is urged, again, that salt preserves the waste of the
tissues, and that animals, fed upon salt, become fat.
There is but little evidence for this; but I shall grant its
truth, for the sake of argument. Granting it to be true,
what then?</p>

<p>We know that the antiseptic property of salt, its
affinity for moisture, makes it valuable in the arts for
some purposes, among which, of course, are conspicuous
the preservation of dead animal meats. We see its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>195</span>
effect in the beef or pork barrel, or on dried fish.
It hardens and keeps dry the fibrous tissue so that
oxygen enough cannot be reached to oxidate and break
down the tissue by what is known as decomposition. If
the salt were all withdrawn by solutions of water (whatever
might be the effect on the meat itself) there would
ensue no harm in its use in preserving food. Notoriously
it is not done, and even greater is the necessity for removing
the nitrate of potash with which the curing is
assisted.</p>

<p>Is not the action of the salt in the system on the effete
or dying tissues the same, in kind, as upon those in the
brine barrel? I see nothing in the vital economy to
negative the presumption. The particles of dead and
oxidised tissue on their way out of the body, so far as
they are brought within the influence of the salt—and
this, as it floats in solution all over the body with the
blood, must be general—are robbed of their moisture,
dried, hardened, pickled, and their passage along the
finer canals made more difficult. They lodge and remain,
and hence account, in part, for the increased weight
of the body. The added weight represents in part filth
which ought to be outside of the body, not inside.</p>

<p>Many other objections might be urged to the use of
salt, in this place; but space forbids. When anyone
examines the evidence carefully and impartially, he
will find that there is not one solitary argument in
favour of the habit that will stand the test of criticism;
while there are many arguments, on the contrary, which
conclusively prove it to be injurious and unphysiological.
The single argument, based upon the undoubted <i>fact</i>
that many hundreds of people in the United States
and elsewhere, have totally abandoned salt, and have not
depreciated themselves in consequence, but have on
the contrary, improved their health and general physical
condition, is proof in itself that salt-eating is a habit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>196</span>—
is not necessary, but is, on the other hand, positively
injurious. When we take these facts into consideration,
we can come to no other conclusion but that salt-eating
is a <i>habit</i>, pure and simple, which is not only unnecessary,
but is exceedingly detrimental to the physical
health of the individual who continually eats it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Pepper</i> is not, like salt, a mineral substance; it is a
vegetable poison. Flies will not touch it, neither will
they eat salt. Black pepper, if taken upon an empty
stomach in the moderate quantity of a teaspoonful,
will either be promptly ejected, or it will cause great
disturbance in the stomach and bowels, and also in the
heart’s action, after it enters the circulation. It is in
no sense a food, but in every sense a stimulant, which is
but another name for a substance non-usable by the
vital organs, and therefore to be thrown out of the vital
domain. Red or black pepper is a prolific cause, as
are all stimulants, of enlargement of the blood vessels,
and ultimately of disease of the heart. Its immediate
effect upon the tongue, throat, stomach and bowels is to
cause an increased action, not only of the capillaries,
causing temporary congestion and even inflammation
of the mucous surfaces, but also of the organs which
secrete the digestive fluids. Its ultimate effect is to
weaken and deaden these organs, by repeated stimulation,
to abnormal action; it also impairs or destroys the
organs of taste within the mouth, together with the
gastric or other nerves which aid in the process of digestion.
When these are weakened by stimulants, the
functions themselves are necessarily impaired, and confirmed
dyspepsia, with its attendant train of bad
symptoms, brings up the rear.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that <i>ginger</i>, <i>spices</i>, <i>nutmeg</i>,
<i>cinnamon</i>, and all that class of condiments, however
much they may vary in quality, are stimulating to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>197</span>
greater or a less degree, and must be put in the list of
“things forbidden” in the hygienic dietary. The habit,
every year increasing, of using spices and condiments in
almost every article of food, and in such large quantities,
cannot be too severely condemned. The end must be
hopeless indigestion, with prostration of the nerves
which supply the digestive organs, and detriment or
ruin to the entire system.</p>

<p>In the language of Sylvester Graham:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The stern truth is, that no purely stimulating substance
of any kind can be habitually used by man, without
injury to the whole nature.”</p></div>

<p>Nor does Dr Graham stand alone in his views upon
this subject. Pereira says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The relish for flavouring or seasoning ingredients
manifested by every person, would lead us to suppose
that these substances serve some useful purpose beyond
that of merely gratifying the palate. At present, however,
we have no evidence that they do. They stimulate,
but do not seem to nourish. The volatile oil they
contain is absorbed, and then thrown out of the system,
still possessing its characteristic odour.”</p></div>

<p>Dr Beaumont is essentially of the same opinion. He
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Condiments, particularly those of a spicy kind, are
non-essential to the process of digestion in a healthy
state of the system. They afford no nutrition. Though
they may assist the action of a debilitated stomach
for a time, their continued use never fails to produce an
indirect debility of that organ. They affect it as alcohol
and other stimulants do—the present relief afforded
is at the expense of future suffering.”</p></div>

<p>In doing away with spices and condiments we must
also dispense with <i>pickles</i>; there is nothing in a pickle
to redeem it from hopeless condemnation. The spices
in it are bad, and the vinegar is a seething mass of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>198</span>
rottenness, full of animalculæ, and the poor little innocent
cucumber, or other vegetable, if it had a little
“character” in the beginning, must now fall into the
ranks of the “totally depraved.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Mustard.</i>—Dr William Tibbles, in his “Food and
Hygiene,” p. 213, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mustard is a greenish yellow powder, without
smell, when it is dry, but when moist, having a pungent
taste and penetrating odour, which is irritating to the
nose and eyes. Mustard is the most familiar of all
condiments. It produces a sensation of warmth in the
mouth and stomach and augments the digestive secretions,
by increasing the circulation in the blood-vessels
in the alimentary canal. It increases the appetite and
the desire for food, and assists in its digestion.”</p></div>

<p>In other words, what really happens is this: Mustard
is an irritant and a stimulant to the mucous membranes
at all times, and for that reason, harmful.
Delicate membranes, such as those of the nose and eyes,
detect and resent this irritation at once; but the throat
and stomach, being rendered more or less inert and unresponsive,
because of years of perverse living on cooked
foods, spices, stimulants, and irritants, do not resent
and react against this particular irritant as forcibly as
do the other membranes. The fact, however, that the
secretion is increased, and that the circulation in the
blood vessels of the stomach is augmented, clearly
indicates that nature is endeavouring to offset and
rid the system as speedily as possible of this irritant
poison. When any poison is introduced into the alimentary
canal, the system immediately pours out its
secretions, in an attempt to liquefy, antidote, and wash
through the invading poison as rapidly as possible.
That is the <i>rationale</i> of the action of all purgatives, and
is the reason why increased secretion and circulation is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>199</span>
noted whenever stimulants or irritants are introduced
into the alimentary canal. The very fact that these
physiological disturbances take place indicates clearly
that the substance that has been ingested is poisonous,
and detrimental to the vital economy. For that reason,
and because of these symptoms, mustard must be debarred
from any hygienic diet; and for the same reason,
white, black, and cayenne pepper, paprika, cloves, nutmeg,
curry powder, garlic, salt, and similar substances
must be eliminated from any diet that is to be considered
wholesome, and in accordance with the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Indeed, in writing of all condiments, Dr Tibbles himself
was forced to admit that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Healthy individuals with normal digestion do not
need them, and they should most certainly be withheld
from children.”</p></div>

<p>I would add to this that if they are to be withheld
from healthy individuals and children, they should
most certainly and more particularly be withheld from
invalids, and from the debilitated and enfeebled. Were
the true <i>rationale</i> of the action of stimulants understood,
this would be so apparent as to render further comment
unnecessary. If it were once fully understood that
stimulants, instead of adding energy <i>to</i> the system,
merely called it forth <i>from</i> the system, there could no
longer be any excuse for their use, upon the ground that
they are necessary and suitable articles of food.
Condiments and spices of all kinds might easily be
eliminated from a hygienic diet, and nothing but increased
health and energy would follow the results of
this process of elimination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Vinegar.</i>—So far from being a true article of food,
or an alimentary substance, vinegar, like alcohol, is a
product of vegetable decay, and is always injurious to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>200</span>
the human stomach. In addition to this, it contains
a large number of germs which, introduced into the
system, are liable to cause great havoc. If acid is required,
it may be obtained in a variety of forms, and
is readily supplied by all acid fruits, and particularly
by lemons. The citric acid of the lemon is appropriable
by the system, and is one of the most wholesome acids
known to us. It will readily take the place of vinegar—on
occasions where we have been in the habit of using
the latter substance. It should be noted in this connection
that lemon juice, when ingested into the human
system, is invariably split up, in the course of a few
hours, and the all-day effects of the acid is to <i>decrease</i>
the acidity of the system, and to increase the alkalinity
of the blood. This was conclusively proved by Dr
Haig, in England, and now forms a large part of his
treatment for all uric acid diatheses. The immediate
effect of the acid is to increase the acidity; but, owing
to the fact that it is split up, as stated, the all-day effects
are invariably to decrease the acidity, and rid the system
of its uric acid. No such beneficial results are observable
from the practice of drinking vinegar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Oils—Olive Oil.</i>—Under “oils” may be classed,
roughly speaking, all fats, animal and vegetable, such
as suet, lard, tallow, marrow, grease, butter, blubber,
and the oils of various nuts. Animal oils are amongst
the least nutritious, and most injurious kinds of alimentary
substances. The oils from the vegetable
kingdom are far more wholesome, and, to a normal
stomach, almost innocuous. If oils or fatty matter of
any kind are desired in the diet, these might just as
well be supplied from the vegetable world as from the
animal; and the oils are obtained free from the impure
materials, which invariably accompany animal fats.
In other words, the same amount of fatty materials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>201</span>
may be obtained, without ingesting at the same time
the toxic substances which invariably accompany the
fats derived from the animal kingdom. Of those fats
which are derived from the animal world, more or less
directly, butter and cream are doubtless the most
wholesome; but there are many objections to both of
these, as I have pointed out elsewhere.</p>

<p>Olive oil, when obtained pure, is doubtless the best
form of oil that we know. The chief difficulty is in
obtaining it in a pure state. Cotton seed oil is generally
sold on the market in place of olive oil, and is in many
ways detrimental to the organism. “Sylmar” olive
oil is a pure oil of the first quality, made from ripe
olives, and can heartily be recommended. A few of the
best French and Italian oils are also excellent, if they
are obtained direct and unadulterated.</p>

<p>The ripe olive contains just what an ordinary vegetarian—especially
fruit—diet lacks. In being a wholesome
source of fat they materially add to the value of
other vegetarian dishes. Nuts also supply oils in a
healthful form. Those oils are serviceable in nervous
disorders, rheumatism, diabetes, and other diseases.</p>

<small>THE FRUITARIAN DIET</small></h2></div>


<p>Anyone who has followed me through the preceding
chapters will probably have come to the conclusion that
there is no article of diet left which he can live upon and
eat without detriment! Apparently everything has
been condemned in turn. Meat, game, fish, shellfish,
soups of all kinds, vegetables, grains, flours, cereals,
milk, cheese, butter, eggs and dairy products of all
kinds, stimulants, spices, jellies—all have been examined
in turn, and found unsuitable for human food.
But man must live, and the question remains: Are
there <i>any</i> foods which he can eat freely and live—not
only without detriment to himself, but with positive
benefit—feeling assured that they are upbuilding his
body, his mind, and his energies, and sustaining his
physiological integrity, throughout, in a wholesome
and natural manner? It will be seen in going over the
list that two important articles of diet have been
omitted—viz. fruits and nuts. These, and these alone,
supplemented, perhaps, by one or two other articles of
diet, can, I contend, sustain man in a perfect state of
health; can supply all the needs of his body, and preserve
the highest standard of health and energy;
while the diet is in accord with his physiological mechanism,
and his anatomical structure. The one or two
articles of diet that might be added (though I do not
consider it necessary that they should be added) are
honey, olive oil, and, occasionally, perhaps, whole-wheat
bread. It is an interesting fact that there are only two
articles of diet in the world, apparently, made exclusively
for food—milk and honey. The milk is to nourish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>203</span>
the young of the animal which secretes it, and normally
the supply would be terminated when the animal was
weaned—if nature were not perverted, and the process
of milking instituted. But we have considered milk as
an article of diet in the former pages. Honey is manufactured
by the bees for the express purpose of supplying
them with food during the winter months, and man
only obtains his supply by robbing the bees of their hard-earned
food, and substituting other food in its place.
Honey contains a large amount of valuable saccharine
material, and I have endeavoured to show on a previous
page that a certain amount of saccharine matter, or
sweet-stuff, is necessary for the maintenance of health—probably
a larger quantity than we are in the habit of
supposing. This, honey will supply. It may be noted,
however, that certain sweet fruits, notably dates, also
contain large amounts of sugar, and if a quantity of
dates were eaten, they would doubtless supply all the
demands of the system for sugar, without recourse to
honey at all. Olive oil is a suitable and nutritive food,
when pure. Its chief value, of course, consists in the
large amount of oil or fatty matter it contains, but this
is also contained in nuts of various kinds in a pure form,
and hence is not a necessary article of diet. As found
on the market, moreover, it is generally impure and
adulterated. Whole-wheat bread has certain advantages,
but is also open to numerous objections, as before
pointed out; and, if made from the whole grain, including
the husk, it acts as an irritant on the mucous
membrane of the bowel, and hence exercises a slightly
purgative action; the same action, however, may be
induced by a plentiful supply of non-irritating fruit
juices, and for that reason they are consequently to be
preferred. We thus come to the conclusion that,
although these few remaining articles of diet are not
positively pernicious, as are the general run of foods,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>204</span>
they are, nevertheless, of secondary importance, and
can readily be dispensed with, and their place taken by
simple fruits and nuts.</p>

<p>If any lingering doubt exists in the minds of those
upholding a strict fruitarian dietary, as to its sufficiently
nutritive value, these doubts have been cleared away
by the investigations of Professor M. E. Jaffa, of the
University of California. His researches, published
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, make an epoch
in the history of dietetics, and his researches are
most conclusive. In his “Nutrition Investigations
Among the Fruitarians and Chinese,” he says, in
part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would appear upon examining the recorded data
and comparing the results with commonly accepted
standards, that all the subjects were (<i>i.e.</i> should have
been) decidedly under-nourished, even making allowances
for their little weight. But when we consider that
the two adults have lived upon this diet for 7 years,
and think they are in better health and capable of more
work than they ever were before, we hesitate to pronounce
judgment. The three children, though below
the average in height and weight, had the appearance
of health and strength. They ran and jumped and
played all day like ordinary healthy children, and were
said to be unusually free from colds and other complaints
incident to childhood.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></div>

<p>Professor Jaffa then showed that N. was actually
<i>stored</i> on this diet, although these fruitarians were eating
but two meals a day, in place of the usual three of
civilised people. He stated (what I have invariably
found to be the case) that <i>less food</i> was required and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>205</span>
was eaten, than is the case with ordinary cooked foods.
Further, many of his subjects were found actually to
<i>gain</i> weight—one patient seven pounds in less than three
months! Professor Jaffa was forced to the conclusion
that fruits must be considered as <i>true foods</i>, and not
mere food accessories; and was bound to admit that
they alone (with nuts) can sustain a healthy and vigorous
life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While it is true that 10 cents will buy more animal
protein than fruit protein, it will on the average purchase
fully as much energy, when spent for fresh fruits, and
more in the case of dried fruits than when expended
for lean meats. When considering nuts, it is readily
observed that 10 cents will buy about the same amount
of nut protein as of animal protein, except in the case
of cheese and skim milk. If spent on peanuts, it will
furnish more than twice the protein and six times the
energy that could be bought for the same expenditure
for porterhouse steak.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></div>

<p>I would also refer the reader to Professor C. F. Longworthy’s
“Fruit and its Uses as Food” (Yearbook,
U.S. Dept. of Agr.).</p>

<p>Speaking of the value of fruit, Dr Tibbles, in his
“Food and Hygiene,” p. 174, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The value and importance of fresh fruit, especially
to dwellers in towns, cannot be too freely written about....
The organic salts in fruit arouse the appetite, and
aid digestion, by increasing the flow of saliva, and, indirectly,
of the gastric juice; they are stimulants and
sialagogues. As the fruit reaches the intestines, the acids
increase the activity of the chyme, and stimulate the
secretions of the liver and the pancreas, the intestinal
glands and muscles; their influence upon the blood is
marked: they render it less alkaline, but <i>never acid</i>.
By combining with a portion of the alkaline salts of the
serum, the phosphoric acid increases the phosphates in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>206</span>
the red blood cells; they are anti-scorbutic and of value
in anæmia, general debility, and convalescence from
acute illness. Fruits containing oxalates, as tomatoes,
gooseberries and strawberries, are useful in amenorrhœa
and for persons subject to bronchitis and asthma;
such as contain salicylic acid—as strawberries, raspberries,
currants, blackberries, and oranges—are a
valuable addition to the dietary of rheumatic persons.
The final stage in the digestion of fruit is the conversion
of fruit acids and salts into alkaline salts, chiefly carbonates;
they are therefore useful in scurvy, rheumatism,
gout, and other diseases of the uric acid diathesis;
they increase the secretion of the urine and its
alkalinity—indeed they are one of the most certain
agents to render it alkaline, to stimulate the kidneys,
and indirectly the skin, and thereby increase the total
excretion of salts and other materials. Briefly, fresh
fruit is cooling, refreshing, and tends to correct constipation.”</p></div>

<p>Only recently, at the Congress of Surgery, Paris, 1909,
Dr Victor Pauchet, surgeon of the American Hospital,
stated—when indicating what in his opinion were the
ideal bodily conditions for the successful performance
of an operation—that it was necessary for the subject
to have the colon and rectum empty; the bowels free
from gas; the liver and kidneys washed with pure water
in proper quantities, etc., and then went on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“ ... It is necessary to give foods, which, besides
being devoid of toxins, should at the same time be a
bad culture-medium for intestinal germs. These conditions
are fulfilled by a vegetable or especially a fruit
régime. Fruit juice is a purer water than that of the
best spring. Glucose is the best assimilated food. It
is the sustaining, diuretic and nontoxic food. Fruits
should be taken fresh, ripe and of good quality. If
unavailable, cooked dry fruits with a little sugar.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>207</span></p>
<p>The general advantages of fruit as food—instead
of the usual cooked diet—have been so far enumerated,
and are so numerous, that it would seem almost unnecessary
to dwell upon the advantages of each fruit
in turn. The whole system being so much superior,
this detailed defence would seem unnecessary. Nevertheless,
in order to show the great superiority of this
diet, it may be well to enumerate some of the beneficial
effects of each fruit in turn, and point out, briefly,
some of their many excellent qualities. Let us see
what these are.</p>

<p><i>Apples</i> have been called the “king of fruits.” They
contain an abundance of potash, soda and magnesia,
also phosphorus, and for this reason have been considered
especially valuable for nerve and brain food.
The natural acid of the apple is excellent for the teeth
and gums; also for the stomach and intestines. It
seems to possess a great antiseptic and germicidal
quality. They do not increase the acidity in the
stomach, but, on the contrary, decrease it. They
possess fine tonic properties, and are a valuable food,
at the same time. Apples are naturally laxative, and
the proportions of their composition are more clearly
adjusted to the human constitution than any other
single fruit. It is almost possible to live upon apples
alone, and an exclusive apple dietary might be tried
for some time during every summer, at least. In the
form of cider they supply us with almost the only
wholesome article of drink, besides water, that can be
found.</p>

<p>The <i>banana</i> is a very heavy food, and must be eaten
with discretion. It has been called the “bread of the
tropics,” and this fact must be borne in mind when
they are being consumed in large quantities. One must
be sure that the banana is sound and thoroughly
ripe when eaten—so soft, almost, as to be taken with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>208</span>
a spoon. The skin should be almost black, and this
should be peeled back, and the outside of the fruit
scraped with a knife, cleaning it of the soft, pulpy
covering about a sixteenth of an inch thick all round
the fruit, which is highly indigestible. Bananas do
not agree with many persons, and when this is found to
be the case they should be avoided; but when they
have been treated in the manner indicated, it will be
found that many persons can eat them, when formerly
this was impossible. Bananas should be very
thoroughly masticated, and possibly mashed up with
a fork before they are eaten. They combine well with
but few foods, and generally should be eaten alone.
Under such conditions, bananas will be found a highly
nourishing and valuable food.</p>

<p><i>Pears</i>, <i>quinces</i>, <i>plums</i>, <i>damsons</i>, <i>peaches</i>, <i>apricots</i>,
<i>cherries</i> and <i>grapes</i>, all contain a fairly high percentage
of carbohydrates, and a high percentage of valuable
food-salts. As is well known, it is possible to live upon
grapes alone for several weeks at a time, as has been
abundantly proved at the various resorts where the
“grape cure” is taken. At such places, several pounds
of grapes are eaten daily, and in phthisis and other
wasting diseases this cure has been attended with some
remarkable results. Sweet grapes are exceedingly
valuable as a food: they contain a large percentage
of water in the purest form; they also contain glucose,
or grape-sugar, in a condition in which it is readily
assimilated into the circulation. Instead of eating
great quantities of starch, therefore, which requires
much effort for proper conversion into this same grape
juice within the body, why not eat the grapes themselves—thereby
obtaining this material in its original
and purest form? In chronic bronchitis, heart disease,
gastric and intestinal atony, and frequently in Bright’s
disease, grapes are very beneficial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>209</span></p>

<p><i>Raspberries</i> and <i>strawberries</i> contain a large amount
of acid, and for that reason must be eaten with discrimination,
especially at first. Yet they are as a rule
an exceptionally wholesome fruit, their natural acidity
clearing the blood of uric acid and kindred poisons,
and acting as a natural tonic and stimulant. The
strawberry also contains a large quantity of iron, and
for that reason is very valuable for anæmic patients.
There are a few individuals who cannot eat strawberries
without unpleasant consequences. Needless to say,
such persons should refrain from eating them, though
the fault in such cases is probably more in the patient
than in the fruit.</p>

<p>The <i>pineapple</i> is a spurious fruit, or rather a collection
of berries, each corresponding to a flower which,
under cultivation, is seedless. The juice is highly
antiseptic, and of great benefit in certain afflictions of
the throat. In diphtheria it appears to be especially
valuable, the juice possessing a cleansing quality of
remarkable power. Its effect upon diseased mucous
is very noticeable, yet, strange to say, its action upon
healthy mucous, in limited quantities, is quite harmless
and rather invigorating. This is proved by the fact
that pineapple juice has often been given to babies
less than a year old, with nothing but beneficial results.</p>

<p>The great value of <i>oranges</i> and <i>lemons</i> is now beginning
to be appreciated. In all uric acid diatheses,
the juice of either one of these fruits—particularly
lemons—is exceedingly beneficial, and Dr Haig, of
London, strongly recommends lemonade and lemon
juice for gout, rheumatism, etc., throughout his writings.
Lemon juice has also been advocated as a
curative agency in malaria—this having the support
of so orthodox an organ as <i>The Lancet</i>. It is now
frequently administered in cases of diphtheria, since
it has been found to afford great relief to the sore and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>210</span>
inflamed throat and gullet. Lemons are strongly
germicidal and antiseptic, and, although their immediate
effect is to increase the acidity of the blood,
curiously enough, their all-day effect is to increase its
alkalinity. The juice of oranges is anti-scorbutic,
and is said to be valuable in influenza. A patient can
live on oranges alone for several weeks together, while
the juice is free from the excessive acidity noticed in
the lemon.</p>

<p><i>Bilberries</i>, <i>whortleberries</i>, <i>cranberries</i>, <i>mulberries</i>, <i>gooseberries</i>,
etc., are all more or less laxative and soothing,
and some of them especially valuable in affections of
the throat.</p>

<p><i>Raisins</i> and <i>currants</i>, properly speaking, belong to
the class of dried fruits, and possess all the advantages
and disadvantages they possess.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb</i>, strictly speaking, is not a fruit, but might
be classed with fruit. It is slightly tonic and aperient.</p>

<p><i>Melons</i> contain but little nutriment, but, on the
contrary, nothing deleterious.</p>

<p><i>Citrons</i> and <i>limes</i> possess very much the same properties
as oranges and lemons, and are now considered
of undoubted value in scurvy and rheumatism, and for
checking nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p>The <i>tomato</i>, which might be classed as a fruit, contains
a large amount of saccharine matter, and salts,
and is stated to have beneficial effects upon the secretions
of the liver.</p>

<p><i>Figs</i> contain from 60 to 70 per cent. of sugar, and
are very nutritive. They also contain some valuable
food-salts. <i>Dates</i> are the great sources of sugar in the
fruit kingdom. They are very nutritious and also
contain valuable food-salts.</p>

<p>Coming now to <i>nuts</i>, they are, as before pointed out,
the great source of proteid—outside meat and certain
legumes. When thoroughly masticated, they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>211</span>
a wholesome and very nutritious article of diet. They
are less liable to cause indigestion when they form
the sole element of the meal, or when mixed only with
fruit, than when eaten in combination with any other
food. They contain practically the elements of a
perfect food in due proportion—supplying the system
with proteids, fats, carbohydrates and salts in a concentrated
form, with but little waste. In addition to
the nitrogenous matter which they contain, they are
also a valuable, and in fact the chief, source of fats.
Brazil nuts, almonds, filberts, pecans, walnuts, etc.,
all contain about the same proportions of carbohydrates,
fats and proteids, and all contain valuable
food-salts. On the whole, it may be said that they are
the most valuable articles of food that we know, and
when supplemented by a few fruits, form a perfect and
nutritious diet. Occasionally, it may be found that
nuts disagree or cause gastric disturbance. In such
cases, various nut-butters may be substituted, or the
nut-food omitted altogether for a few weeks, as it is
more than probable, in such cases, that the system is
already overstocked with nitrogenous matter. But
I believe that, if properly masticated, eaten in
limited quantities, and judiciously combined with a
small number of other foods—especially fruits—it will
be found that they do not disagree, but, on the contrary,
are a sustaining and nourishing food—in fact <i>the most</i>
sustaining and nourishing food that can be found.</p>

<p>Fruit juices are especially cooling and refreshing in
the heat of summer. They supply organic fluids to the
system, in the form of water, combined with organic
salts, and this water is the purest that we know.
Sour fruits of all kinds are especially valuable in cases
of biliousness, inactive liver, thickening of the blood,
and general clogging-up of the system. They are
especially valuable in cases of disordered digestion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>212</span>
Fruits should not be cooked, but eaten raw, and upon
an empty stomach, or combined with nuts. When
combined with cooked foods, and especially with vegetables,
they tend to create, as we have seen, gastric
disturbances. The cooking of fruits ruins many of
their most valuable properties. Ordinary sugar should
never be added to fruits, since it excites fermentation;
and, for cooking purposes, if fruits are cooked and it is
desired to sweeten them, dates may be added for this
purpose. By all means fruit should be avoided at
the end of a meal consisting of a combination of foods,
and particularly of cooked foods; they are sure to
disagree, and the fruits will then get blamed for the
whole disturbance!</p>

<p>Sylvester Graham, in writing of fruits as food, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It should always be remembered that fruit of every
description, if eaten at all, should be eaten as food,
and not as mere pastime, or merely for the sake of
gustatory enjoyment; and therefore it should, as a
general rule, be eaten at the table, or constitute a portion
of the regular meal.... All cooked food, even under
the best regulations, impairs in some degree the power
of the stomach to digest uncooked substances; and
therefore, so long as we are accustomed to cooked
food of any kind, we must be somewhat more careful
in regard to the times when we eat fruit and other
substances in their natural state.”</p></div>

<p>Now, if we compare the fruitarian dietary—meaning
by this a diet composed of fruit and nuts, in their
natural and uncooked state—with other diets, we shall
ascertain the following facts:—</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>First</i>, that such a diet is suited to man because of his
anatomical and physiological structure. We have
seen in Chapters II. and III. that, were we to judge
from his anatomy and physiology, man must be classed
as a frugivorous animal—with the higher apes—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>213</span>
that he is totally dissimilar in construction to any of
the other animals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Second.</i> By comparing these foods with other food-stuffs,
we found, in the chapter on the chemistry of
foods, that all the elements essential for sustaining
the physiological integrity were supplied by a judicious
fruitarian diet—the proteids, carbohydrates and fats
all being supplied by such foods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Third.</i> While all these elements are supplied, we do
not ingest into the system at the same time injurious
toxic substances as we do in the case of meats; or
enormous quantities of fibrous, indigestible elements,
as we do in the case of vegetables; or innutritious and
constipating substances, as we do in all starchy foods.
In addition to this, condiments and spices are not called
for, and in fact cannot well be eaten with such foods.
The oils and fats furnished by this diet are also pure,
and are free from all the objections that can be raised
to these same substances when derived from the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p>As a further argument, it will be found that <i>less food</i>
in quantity is eaten and called for upon this diet,
and that the system is in less danger of becoming
surfeited, blocked and choked with an excess of food-matter.
Fruits are also easily digestible, and act as a
stimulant upon the various internal organs, and as a
mild aperient. They also contain the minimum
amount of earthy matter, which various authors have
contended is the chief cause of obstruction, induration,
ossification, premature old age and natural death.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that there are many advantages,
and no disadvantages, to this diet. Since it contains
all the elements which the system requires in a purer and
better form, and can be assimilated with less energy;
and since, moreover, it does not engender any of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>214</span>
diseased states or conditions which result from an ordinary
diet, it will be seen that this system presents many
advantages over any other so far presented—or, in fact,
any other that can be formulated. In addition to this,
and one very strong argument in favour of the fruitarian
diet, is the fact that a certain <i>vital energy</i>—too subtle to
be analysed by the chemist, and which will only be
recognised by science when it becomes less materialistic—is
imparted, upon a raw fruitarian diet, which is invariably
lost whenever food of any kind is cooked.
Dr Graham, in his “Science of Human Life,” was probably
the first to call attention to this fact. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be laid down as a general law that all processes
of cooking, or artificial preparation of foods by
fire, are, in themselves, considered with reference to the
very highest and best condition of human nature, in
some degree detrimental to the physiological and psychological
interests of man.”</p></div>

<p>He insists, further, that if man lived upon uncooked
foods, he would have to use his teeth, and would therefore
preserve them; he would masticate his food more
thoroughly, and by thorough insalivation fit it for the
stomach; he would swallow it slowly, instead of bolting
it down in a crude condition; he would take it at a
proper temperature, and not weaken the stomach with
hot food; he would eat the food as nature prepares it,
not served in the form of a highly concentrated aliment;
he would partake of the simple, individual food substances,
and would not suffer from all manner of injurious
combinations; and finally, he would be less likely to
suffer from over-eating than he would if he lived upon
soft, cooked foods. There can be no question that the
thorough mastication of nuts, which is rendered necessary
by their nature, is one of the best means possible of preserving
and strengthening both the teeth and the gums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>215</span></p>

<p>Dr Gustave Schlickeysen, in his “Fruit and Bread,”
has adduced very strong arguments in favour of an
uncooked fruitarian diet. Writing of the advantages
of such a diet, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of all the artificial forms of treatment to which
foods are subjected, that of cooking is the most universal
and therefore demands our special attention. If we
rightly consider the influence of this process upon all the
natural properties of a plant, we must perceive that it is,
in almost every case, injurious, and that it must be
dispensed with, so far as our present habits of life will
admit of, with a view of its final and complete disuse.
The natural fluids of the plant are in great part lost in
cooking, and with them the natural aroma so agreeable
to the senses and so stimulating to the appetite. The
water supplied artificially does not possess the same
properties as that which has been lost, and all the less so
since it has been boiled. The cellular tissue of the plant
loses also its vitality, and ripe, uncooked fruits and
grains with their unbroken cellular tissue, their stimulating
properties, their great content of water, sugar and
acids, and their electrical vitality are calculated to
supply to the human body a rosy freshness; to the skin
a beautiful transparence, and to the whole muscular
system the highest vigour and elasticity. Uncooked
fruits especially excite the mind to its highest activity.
After eating them we experience an inclination to
vigorous exercise, and also an increase of capacity for
study and all mental work—while cooked food causes a
feeling of satiety and sluggishness. Not only do plants
lose their vital, but to some extent also their nutritive
properties when cooked. The vegetable acids and oils,
the latter being of especial value in the development of
the bony structure of the body, are, by cooking, dissipated;
while the albuminoids are coagulated, and
thereby less easily digested, so that the nutritive value
of the food is reduced to a minimum. Another injury
that results from cooked food is that caused by artificial
heat. All heat excites, through expansion, an increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>216</span>
activity, but this activity is not normal in the case of
food eaten hot.</p>

<p>“Again, the sensory nerves of the lips and the nerves
of taste are weakened by hot food to such an extent that
they no longer serve as an infallible test of its quality,
and hence articles that seem in the mouth to be palatable
and good may be very injurious to the system, both
on account of their natural properties and their artificial
heat. In a similar manner the sense of smell is blunted;
and not less injuriously does hot food act upon the teeth,
the enamel of which is destroyed, rendering them unfit
for their work of mastication, in consequence of which
the food passes unprepared into the stomach. The eyes
are also injured by the action of hot food upon the
nerves connected with them. That condition of weak
and watery eyes, so apparent in the habitual drunkard,
exist in a certain degree in all whose systems are
enervated by hot and stimulating food. But the
greatest harm from hot food is caused in the stomach
itself, the coats of which are irritated, reddened, and
unnaturally contracted by the heat, so that they lose
their vigorous activity and capacity for the complete
performance of their natural functions. The blood,
excited by the heat, flows in excess to the stomach, and
thence feverishly through the body. One result of
this is the flushed condition of the head after eating.
Hot food also causes an excess in eating, so that it is
rather by a sense of fullness and oppression than by a
natural satisfaction of the appetite that one is prompted
to cease eating. An evidence of the weakening of the
stomach by hot food is seen when one eats an apple after
the usual hot meal. Fruit thus taken lies like a stone
upon the stomach, the enfeebled nerves being injuriously
affected by its presence; whereas in their normal condition,
they are stimulated to a most agreeable activity
by it.</p>

<p>“From the abuse of the organs of digestion result a
number of diseases. A life-long weakness of the gastric
nerves, with cramps and inflammation of the stomach,
are its common fruits. To this cause also is attributable
the almost universal prevalence of colds, which are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>217</span>
direct result of unnatural temperatures of the body.
The blood, artificially heated, causes an excessive perspiration,
since it produces increased but injurious
activity of the skin; and upon the least change of
temperature the perspiration is condensed upon the
body, and causes colds and stiffness, and this is all the
more certainly so when the blood is impure and the
tissues overloaded. From the same prolific cause results
the uneasiness and languor experienced after eating hot
food. The evil effect cannot be overcome by the usual
after-dinner nap. This cannot replace the elements
lost from our food, nor give the enlivening impulse
experienced after partaking of ripe fruits in their natural
state.</p>

<p>“It is indeed argued that our northern climate requires
that food should be eaten hot as one means of
maintaining the bodily temperature; but if this be true
of man, it must apply with equal force to all animals;
and since man alone seems to require hot food, the
argument loses its force. In the polar regions the conditions
of animal life show plainly that the natural process
of generating heat is not by putting heated substances
into the stomach, but by the normal action of
the vital forces upon food taken in its natural state.
Greater thirst is experienced after eating cooked than uncooked
food, and this results both from the change that
the food has undergone, and from the perspiration
caused by the increased heat of the body. The artificial
solution of the food impairs its nutritive properties,
and weakens the natural functions of the body by depriving
them of their natural employment; and this
has been so long continued that we are now almost
incapable of digesting uncooked grains, so that their
enlivening and invigorating action is almost unknown.”</p></div>

<p>Dr Schlickeysen argues very strongly for what he
terms the “electrical vitality” of food, which he contends—I
think rightly—is ruined by cooking. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Finally—and this is a point which physiologists
have hitherto quite overlooked—the food must contain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>218</span>
a certain <i>electrical vitality</i>. Although the real origin
and nature of the vital force is not yet known, we believe
that it is closely related to electricity; not less
so, indeed, than to light and heat. Electricity is
abundant in all purely natural products, and indeed,
everywhere where a free and uninterrupted exchange of
the influences of light, heat, and air, exist. It is less
abundant in closed dwelling and sleeping rooms than
in the open air. An outdoor walk refreshes us, not only
by the increased consumption of oxygen, but by the
increased action of the electrical forces. The same
vitality is stored up in uncooked plants and fruits, but
it is greatly impaired by all our culinary processes.
Fruits act also through their natural acids, their refreshing
coolness, and the easy assimilation of their
albuminous products, and other nourishing materials.</p>

<p>“By the ‘electrical vitality’ of food we do not mean
its nutritive worth, nor indeed any material element of
it, but rather an imponderable fluid, which is related
to the vital and electrical forces of the human system.
The organic vital force has not incorrectly been called
the interrogation point of physiology, and the physiologists
and chemists of the old school thought to maintain
this force by supplying albuminoids to the system.
The fact, however, is the reverse. The albuminoids
demand rather a great expense of vitality for their
solution and digestion. We know now, with great
certainty, and by practical experience, that the human
system is maintained and strengthened by the consumption
of fresh air, fresh water, and ripe fruits, and
grains; but these essential means of sustenance are
reduced from the rank of vital to merely nutritive substances
by any treatment that, through heat or otherwise,
destroys their natural vitality. Our physiologists
have not hitherto understood this difference between the
vital and the merely nutritive properties of food, and
hence, as we have already pointed out, have regarded
foods as merely chemical substances. They have discovered
and laid down with wonderful exactness, the
chemical elements of the living body, and hence of the
food requisite, according to their views, to its mainten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>219</span>ance;
but we hope to show that their methods and consequently
their dietetic conclusions, have been one-sided,
and therefore essentially erroneous. So long as the
electrical vitality of food is overlooked, and the bearings
of anthropology upon the question is ignored, a scientific
system of diet must remain impossible.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></div>

<p>This whole question of the injurious effect in cooking
food may be summed up in a very few words. Heat
destroys the life and vitality of the food, and practically
nothing is left but the “ashes,” as it were, which
are dead, inert, and comparatively of far less food value
than the raw foods. It can readily be seen why this
must be so. At a temperature of 150° F., certain
properties of all organic substances are destroyed, or
even at a temperature below this. This can readily be
proved in the case of all living organisms, and it is also
true, to a large extent, in the case of all vegetables,
fruits, and other organic compounds, whose life is also
destroyed at these high temperatures. A leaf of cabbage
immersed in water not too hot to be borne by the hand
will wilt. The effects of heat upon all flowers can very
readily be seen. Their life becomes extinct, and the
vital properties of all organic substances must be ruined
by subjecting them to the tremendous heat necessary
for cooking them. A large part of the nutritive value of
the substance cooked is thus ruined, while, in many
cases, valuable nutritive material passes out of the
substance into the water in which it is cooked, or escapes
altogether. It will thus be seen that, from the physiological
and chemical sides of this question alone, there
are many strong reasons for believing that the cooking
of food is injurious, lowering its nutritive value, and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>220</span></p>
<p>ruining many of its most valuable properties. But
since fruits are almost the only form of food that can
be eaten in a raw state—or rather as cooked by nature—this
would indirectly prove that fruit is man’s natural
diet, thus agreeing with his anatomical structure; and
the fruitarian diet would, on the other hand, indicate
that a raw-food diet is the best that man can adopt.
When we come to consider the fact that no other animal
cooks his food, and that the higher apes—man’s dietetic
counterpart—eats his fruits and nuts in a raw state, we
can readily see that there is no valid reason, apart from
custom, for man cooking his food—so long as the
natural or fruitarian dietary be adopted at all. It is
curious to note the attitude various authorities have
taken upon this subject, when writing of foods in relation
to man’s relative place in nature. Thus, Dr Mattieu
Williams, in his “Chemistry of Cookery,” p. 295, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the outset it is necessary to brush aside certain
false issues that are commonly raised in discussing this
subject. The question is not whether we are herbivorous
or carnivorous animals. It is perfectly certain that
we are neither. The carnivora feed on flesh alone, and
eat that flesh raw. Nobody proposes that we should do
this. The herbivora eat raw grass. Nobody suggests
that we should follow their example.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly clear that man cannot be classed with
the carnivorous animals, nor the herbivorous animals,
nor with the gramnivorous animals. His teeth are not
constructed for munching and grinding raw grain, nor
his digestive organs for assimilating such grain in this
condition.</p>

<p>“He is not even to be classed with the omnivorous
animals. He stands apart from all as <i>The Cooking
Animal</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Here it will be seen that Dr Williams classes man as a
“cooking animal” merely because he has no other
class (according to his own classification) in which to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>221</span>
place him! But it will be observed that no mention
whatever is made of fruitarian diet, or the possibility
of man living upon fruits and nuts alone. He does not
even mention the fact that there are fruitarian animals!
Naturally, if one eliminates a whole class in this way—that
class being the one to which man belongs—it is
impossible to find a rightful place for him; but once
recognise the fruitarian class of animals, and it will be
found that man, structurally, and in every other way,
belongs to it; and for that reason he does not stand
apart by himself as a “cooking animal,” but is simply
one member of the fruitarian family.</p>

<p>There are many other reasons for thinking that the
fruitarian diet is the best, and that uncooked foods
should form man’s staple diet. One of these is that
they are more economical in the long run. While
certain other foods may be purchased at a less cost,
particularly in the winter-time, they are not nearly so
nourishing to the system; and it can be shown that the
nutritive value, per pound, is far greater in the case of
fruits and nuts than is the case with any other articles
of food. For this reason, although fruits and nuts
may cost more, they will ultimately be found to cost
<i>less</i>—because they contain a higher percentage of
nutriment; and indirectly because they avoid doctor’s
bills, and maintain the body in a higher state of health
and energy. They thus enable it to accomplish more
work; and, since work represents, as a rule, financial
return, it will be seen that these foods are in the end
most economic. As before pointed out, moreover,
they do not induce over-eating, as do cooked and
stimulating articles of food.</p>

<p>Fruits also exert a very cleansing and purifying effect
upon the system. Their medicinal value is therefore
not to be omitted from our consideration; and further,
were the fruitarian diet followed, humanity would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>222</span>
escape nine-tenths of the ills from which it now suffers,
because of its over-eating, and its living upon gross
and highly stimulating articles of food, and bad food-combinations.
The choking and blocking effects of
the more solid and earthy food would be avoided—while
indigestion, fermentation, constipation and all
the ills which accompany them would also be entirely
done away with.</p>

<p>This question of the prevention of disease by diet is a
very important one, both from the economic and from
the physiological point of view, and if any diet can be
found which will prevent a large percentage of the
diseases from which mankind suffers, that diet should
surely be adopted. Inasmuch as fruits and nuts are
man’s natural diet, it should be obvious that they are
the ones best suited to his organism, and consequently
those which will maintain it in the highest state of
health. Let us consider this question a little more
fully.</p>

<p>In my previous work, I argued that every article of
diet must be more or less healthful or more or less
injurious, and this being so, only those foods should
be eaten which had been proved by philosophy and
experience to be the most wholesome. The fact that
the system <i>can live</i> upon other foods, and maintain a
certain degree of health, argues merely that it can
<i>withstand</i> the bad effects of these other foods, and by
no means shows us that they are the best! I further
contended that the same foods are alike detrimental or
beneficial to all, and that the old doctrine which Dr
Page called “the most foolish of all aphorisms”—namely,
“one man’s meat, another’s poison”—is totally
false. I contended that, while there might be certain
deviations and variations in the details of the diet,
still all men are <i>rudimentally</i> alike, and that the body
of each human being is made after a certain pattern,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>223</span>
which pattern is in accordance with the general principles
which apply to all individuals. Man, that is,
belongs to a certain <i>genus</i>, and consequently his food
must be, within certain limits, the same as that of the
rest of the family to which he belongs. That is, as we
have seen, the frugivora, and his diet must accordingly
consist of fruits and nuts in their uncooked, primitive
form. There may be certain individual differences,
and there doubtless are. Thus, some individuals
are unable to eat strawberries, others bananas, others
onions, others mushrooms, but this would show, merely,
that these particular individuals, <i>while in the peculiar
state of body in which they then are</i>, are unable to appropriate
and utilise, with benefit, these particular food-stuffs.
The chemical composition of their bodies has
become altered in some way unknown to us, and, as the
result of this altered chemical composition, they are
unable to appropriate, with profit, food containing
certain elements with which they may already be
overstocked. In other words, this would prove, merely,
that, in their present physical condition, they are unable
properly to assimilate and digest those particular food-stuffs.
It does not show that, if they were normal,
these foods could not be appropriated and used with
benefit. In other words, the fault is rather with the
individual than with the food. Still, I admit that
these differences have to be taken into account; and
that no two individuals can be treated exactly alike—especially
at first. To use a simile, no two spokes of a
wheel are identical—that is, each spoke is individual,
and different from all other spokes—but they all lead,
nevertheless, to the hub, the central point which unifies
and combines them all. In a similar manner, I can see
that there is an ideal diet for the human race, which
should be followed by all who are in health, and could
be eaten by all with equal profit and benefit, if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>224</span>
chemical composition of their bodies were altered. But,
as each spoke must be treated individually at first, so
must each individual be treated individually, and, by
gradual changes in the diet, be brought more nearly
to a normal standard, when it will be far easier for it
to adopt a simple fruitarian diet, without any of the
disturbance or unpleasantness that might otherwise
follow. As Dr Jackson expressed it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If I had his ultimate good in view, I should seek
to change the state of his stomach that he might eat
what was in itself better for him, rather than to have his
morbid necessity say what he should be compelled to
eat.”</p></div>

<p>Some readers may contend that I have gone too far
in thus insisting upon an ultimate unification of diet,
and that such a state can not only <i>not</i> be hoped for
practically, but is false theoretically. I myself do not
think so. When discussing this question in my former
book, I said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It must be noticed that, with the single exception
of man, every class of animal feeds upon its own particular
and especial kind of food. All dogs, for example,
eat practically the same food, and about the same
amount of it.. .. When a dog is fed upon milk,
meat, and biscuit, in certain amounts, when living in
England, we do not think of modifying his diet to any
appreciable degree should we take him with us to
America or to the Tropics. The diet might, in the
latter case, be somewhat <i>lessened</i>, but that would effect
its bulk only, not materially effecting the quality of the
food-supply. Again, we should be surprised to find
dogs fed upon altogether different substances in any
portion of the globe to which we might travel; if, <i>e.g.</i>,
they were fed upon turnips, oysters, mince pie, hay and
sauerkraut—yet I must earnestly insist that this unholy
combination is no more bad and unnatural than some
that supposedly ‘civilised’ men and women take into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>225</span>
their stomachs in the course of twenty-four hours!
To be sure, there might be modifications or alterations
in the diet, but the changes would not be of <i>kind</i>,
merely of <i>degree</i>, and we should feel, doubtless, that
these dogs, having their diet altered to an altogether
different kind, live under such abnormal and altered
conditions rather <i>in spite of</i> than on <i>account of</i> their
newly acquired régime, and would be inclined to feel
that the same dogs might be infinitely more healthy
and live longer lives on their normal diet. Similarly
with every other species of animal; each <i>genus</i> has its
proper and natural food, allotted by nature, and any
attempt to depart from this diet, and to live upon
other and altogether unnatural food, must of necessity
weaken, devitalise and eventually destroy the organism
of the animal so attempting to live contrary to nature’s
unchanging dietetic laws.”</p></div>

<p>Now, since we have seen that man is anatomically
and structurally a member of that family whose normal
food is fruits and nuts, he too should live upon that diet
if he wishes to maintain the highest degree of health.
There is only one valid objection to this theory, which
is that man, having lived so many ages upon the cooked
diet, is now more adapted to that diet than to his original
uncooked foods, and that an attempt to return to such
a diet would be attended with grave and possibly
disastrous consequences. As Professor Goodfellow put
it: “The conditions of life have so altered that the
natural food of our ancestors would be unnatural now,
living as we do under such different conditions.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>This objection, however, is completely refuted by the
fact that <i>no anatomical change whatever</i> has taken place
in man’s digestive apparatus since the most primeval
times. If the body had gradually grown accustomed to
the cooked and unnatural foods, this should not be the
case—certain modifications in the digestive apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>226</span>
and perhaps throughout the body should be noted,
corresponding to this altered adaptability. But no such
changes have been observed. As we have seen, man
corresponds structurally throughout with the higher
apes, and he has altered not one whit since the days
when he more closely resembled them than he does now!</p>

<p>The second point to be noted is that such an objection
is not in accord with facts. It is a comparatively
simple thing for the majority of persons to adopt a
fruitarian dietary. They can do so almost at once,
having made up their minds to do so, and thereafter
live upon it exclusively, without harm to themselves,
but, on the contrary, with added health and strength.
There is no real reason to think that, because a thing
has been done for many generations, it is the best
thing which <i>can</i> be done. Experience merely shows
us what <i>has</i> taken place, not what <i>might</i> take place;
and, so far as that goes, experience has shown us in the
past that, living upon the diet they have been accustomed
to, human beings have been constantly suffering
from one form of disease or another, and that they
almost invariably become aged prematurely, lose their
faculties before their allotted time, and die a premature
death. So far as experience can teach us anything,
therefore, it shows most conclusively that such a state
of affairs as has existed in the past is by no means the
most ideal, but, on the contrary, one which should be
avoided and changed, if possible, and rendered more
in accordance with nature’s laws—thus ensuring a
greater degree of health, and a more prolonged and
happy existence.</p>

<p>There is another strong argument in favour of the
fruitarian dietary, and an adoption of the simpler foods,
which is that the adoption of this way of living would
ensure a practical emancipation of women. Under the
present conditions, a wife—if she has a husband and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>227</span>
family, and if she is forced to do her own work, as a
large number are (in America, at least)—spends four or
five hours a day in the kitchen preparing and clearing
up after the three daily meals supplied to the
family. The anxiety and mental tension that she
undergoes in ensuring the correctness of her dishes;
the bending over the hot stove—especially in summer-time—the
constant inhaling of smells and odours,
arising from the cooking food, the fumes from the oils
and fats, the constant tasting of dishes which is necessitated,
all these tell against her health, and age her
prematurely. In addition to this, there is the time
wasted in the preparation of all these foods, and in the
clearing up of the remnants; and when we stop to consider
that all this cooking is not only useless, but positively
detrimental; not only a waste of time, but an
actual injury to the body; and when we know that far
greater health and strength may be preserved upon a
diet consisting wholly of uncooked foods—which require
no preparation and practically no clearing up—we
can see how false is the doctrine at present enunciated,
and slavishly followed by the majority, which tends to
keep woman in a state of bondage, and her time filled
up with petty details of a wholly useless nature—which
time might be better occupied in mental pursuits.
And when we remember, in addition to all this, that
such foods, even when they are prepared, are by no
means so wholesome as a simple fruitarian diet, but are,
on the contrary, positively harmful, we can see that
no time should be lost before we adopt this simplified
diet, and insist upon its acceptance by all persons
calling themselves civilised. From all these points of
view, therefore, we see that there are very strong
grounds for believing that the fruitarian diet is the one
most suited to the body’s needs, and is in every way
the most wholesome and hygienic. I shall now proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>228</span>
to adduce another whole set of facts showing that
fruitarianism is the natural diet of mankind, and that
fruits and nuts, eaten in their uncooked form, are those
most suitable to man, and those best calculated to
preserve him in a high state of mental and physical
health.</p>

<p>Not only do fruits and nuts contain a higher percentage
of nutriment than ordinary foods, and particularly
cooked foods; not only do they maintain the
system in a better state of physical, mental and moral
health; not only do they simplify the wants of the
household, and the toil of the woman; not only are
they more economical in the long run; not only would
the adoption of this diet prevent nine-tenths of the
misery and physical suffering in this world; not only
would it prevent a large part of the crime, debauchery
and drunkenness, but, in addition to all this, the adoption
of such a dietary would be the chief factor in all
social, ethical and agricultural reform. This should be
apparent to anyone who has read through the above
list of reforms made possible by this simple change of
diet. The practical abolition of the traffic in alcohol,
which would certainly result from an adoption of this
diet, would be in itself a tremendous revolution. In
addition to all this, there would be the increased ease
and comfort afforded by the simpler diet. The
economic aspect of this question is one very important
factor. It is possible to live far more cheaply upon
fruits and nuts, when they are in season, than upon any
other foods—quite apart from the general question of
health. The freeing of the body from diseases and the
prolonging of useful life would also be strong arguments
in favour of the simpler diet—since there can be no
question that both these results are effected by its
means.</p>

<p>There are also other arguments in favour of this diet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>229</span>—
arguments that should appeal to many of my readers.
It will be found, <i>e.g.</i>, that the texture and the general
colouring of the skin will improve, upon this diet; the
complexion will become clear, and the eyes will become
bright. This is very noticeable, in many cases. The
brain is also rendered clearer, and more fitted for continued
mental work. Far more work can be performed,
without the exhaustion formerly noted, upon such a diet.
There can be no question whatever that the temper will
invariably improve upon the fruitarian diet. I have
seen many cases of this character. It is only natural
that such should be so. On the ordinary “mixed”
diet, the system is surcharged with toxic substances,
which mix with the blood and irritate the brain cells.
When these irritating substances are removed, the mind
will become clear, and a more even and just view of the
world will be obtained. There can be no question that
there is a close, even intimate, relation between the
mental life and the state of the body; and nothing demonstrates
this more certainly than the adoption of
a fruitarian dietary. I have already referred to the
brutalising effects of meat and the slaughter-house upon
the butcher. It is true, in a lesser degree, with everybody.
The natives of India and elsewhere look with
horror at the practice of meat-eating, and cannot understand
how anyone can be spiritual, or even decently
humane, who kills and eats animals. And yet missionaries,
knowing this, continue to eat their roast beef, in
spite of the fact that natives of the more intelligent
order must despise them in consequence. No wonder
they can accomplish very little, so long as they are
so totally incapable of appreciating the viewpoint of
others, and are unwilling to reform their diet, and adopt
a more simple and humane one—for the sake of their
religion, if not for hygienic reasons!</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the adoption of fruit as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>230</span>
a food would relieve many cases of hitherto incurable
diseases. In cancer, gout, eczema, tumour, etc., the
exclusive fruit diet has been found to bring rapid and
remarkable cures. Moreover, the salts found in fruits
of various kinds are a very important factor—and this,
not only in the sick but in the well.</p>

<p>Dr H. Benjafield, writing in the <i>Herald of Health</i> says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Garrod, the great London authority on gout, advises
his patients to take oranges, lemons, strawberries,
grapes, apples, pears, etc. Jardien, the great French
authority, maintains that the salts of potash found so
plentifully in fruits are the chief agents in purifying the
blood from these rheumatic and gouty poisons....
Dr Buzzard advises the scorbutic to take fruit, morning,
noon and night. Fresh lemon juice in the form of
lemonade is to be his ordinary drink; the existence of
diarrhœa should be no reason for withholding it.”</p></div>

<p>Florence Daniel, in her excellent little book “Food
Remedies,” says of fruits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Salts and acids as found in organised forms are quite
different in their effects to the products of the laboratory,
notwithstanding that the chemical composition may be
shown to be the same. The chemist may be able to
manufacture a ‘fruit juice,’ but he cannot, as yet,
manufacture the actual fruit. The mysterious life
force always evades him. Fruit is a <i>vital</i> food, it supplies
the body with something over and above the mere elements
that the chemist succeeds in isolating by analysis.
The vegetable kingdom possesses the power of directly
utilising minerals, and it is only in this ‘live’ form that
they are fit for the consumption of man. In the consumption
of sodium chloride (common table salt),
baking powders, and the whole army of mineral drugs
and essences, we violate that decree of nature which
ordains that the animal kingdom shall feed upon the
vegetable and the vegetable upon the mineral.”</p></div>

<p>So far back as the beginning of last century, the
famous Dr Lambe, of London, wrote in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>231</span>
fruit diet, and several vigorous reformers soon followed
his example. The system was bitterly attacked, but
these attacks served only to strengthen the defence,
and show the inconsistency of its opponents. Objections
to the fruit diet are constantly being urged, but
not one of them has been shown to rest on a solid
foundation.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the notion that the acids of fruit
injure the teeth. Dentists will frequently tell you that
acids are injurious to the enamel of the teeth, and for
that reason acid fruits most certainly should not be
eaten! The position sounds perfectly logical, and, if
the acids of fruits had the same effect upon the enamel
of the teeth as mineral acid, it would be true. The fact
is, however, that this is not the case, but one does not
really find this out until he becomes a fruitarian. He
then finds that he has no further “use” for the dentist,
and that his fine theoretical knowledge is overthrown
by the actual facts.</p>

<p>Persons often notice that they become—especially at
first—much more acutely sensitive and almost nervous
upon a fruitarian diet. Of course the diet is blamed;
but as a matter of fact it is but indirectly responsible.
The sensibility and nervousness is the result of
previous habits of life—and this transitory condition
is but the manifestation of certain nervous, vital
energies which had, till then, remained “smothered,”
as it were, by the excess of food eaten. Now they rise
to the surface and tend to become noticeable to us
(<i>v.</i> my “Vitality, Fasting and Nutrition,” pp. 520-523).</p>

<p>Further, sensibility, it must be remembered, is merely
another word for extreme sensitiveness or a degree of
reaction of the nervous system—which is its normal
function. A nervous system is made for the express
purpose of reacting immediately, to the most delicate
stimulus—and if it does not do so, it shows that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>232</span>
nervous mechanism is in some way out of order. It
is only because we constantly keep the nervous system
poisoned, by our perverted food habits, that it does not
react as it should. It merely regains some degree of its
normal powers when the fruit diet is adopted.</p>

<p>But I shall probably be told that there are cases in
which a hyper-sensitiveness has become apparent—the
sensitiveness, not of health, but of disease. That I
admit: but I must contend that this extreme sensitiveness
would not have resulted had it not been for the
previous habits of life, which resulted in an accumulation
of irritating poisons within the body; so that, when
these habits are discontinued and the nervous system
invigorated by the improved dietetic habits, the nerves
begin to react vigorously against these irritating poisons.
The result is that a great irritability and hyper-sensitiveness
is noted, <i>pro tem.</i>—which, however, will be found
to disappear (if the diet be persisted in) when the nervous
system again approaches a more normal standard.</p>

<p>There remains one very strong argument in favour of a
fruitarian diet, to which I have not so far referred.
Able authorities affirm that many of the waste places
and deserts of the earth once teemed with fertility
and foliage, and that the existing sterility of these
deserts has been brought about by the destruction of
their forests. The influence of trees upon the rainfall,
and consequent support of vegetation, is so well known
that some of the foremost nations are fostering tree-culture
and taking means to preserve existing forests
by Government enactment. There can be no doubt but
that trees improve the climate, in any neighbourhood;
they improve the soil, reduce the severity of storms and
the cold of winter, and prevent undue evaporation of
moisture from the surface of the ground. But it is unnecessary
to enlarge upon the great value of trees,
which is well known. Now, the point I make is this:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>233</span>
if the fruitarian dietary were adopted, more fruits
and nuts would be eaten, and hence a large number of
trees would be planted—huge orchards would exist
throughout the land. Whereas under cereal culture
there is a constant temptation to the farmer to cut down
his trees to make his lands available for grain-growing;
as soon as a market for fruits and nuts is established,
the same law of pecuniary gain will induce him to transform
his pastures and his grain fields into orchards and
nut groves. This would be highly advantageous in
every respect.</p>

<p>I think it probable that fruits alone contain about all
the nutriment that an average man wants, who is not
working out of doors, and who does not take much exercise.
Oxen will get fat on apples and pears; but when
we set them to work, we have to supply an extra amount
of grains, and foods containing proteid, to offset the
greater destruction of muscular tissue. It is probably
the same with man. In the majority of cases, fruits
alone would probably supply all that the body needs;
but when it was called upon to perform an extra amount
of work, nuts and other proteid-forming foods will be
craved and called for. This, I think, indicates the true
place of nuts and of all foods rich in proteid in the diet.</p>

<p>M. Metchnikoff has argued strongly against the use of
fruits and all raw foods, as liable to introduce bacteria
into the intestines! He believes that old age and
natural death are largely brought about by bacteriological
decomposition in the intestines (in which he is
doubtless right) and believes that raw foods are one of
the chief causes of this intestinal putrefaction. I would
point out, in reply, that bacteria can only exist in a
locality in which there is a suitable soil; and if this soil
is lacking, they cannot exist, no matter how many of
them may be introduced. Now, when the bowel is kept
sweet and clean, as it invariably is by a fruit diet, it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>234</span>
be apparent that there is no soil in which such bacteria
could multiply, hence their continued presence would
be quite impossible. M. Metchnikoff has only studied
cases in which the patient had been nourished by the
ordinary cooked foods, and his conclusions were drawn
from the facts presented to him; but when the diet is
entirely fruitarian, there can be no doubt that such a
state of the bowels would be quite impossible, and there
would consequently be no bacteria present; and if
they <i>were</i> introduced, they could not live in such a
medium. The bowel, in the case of those living upon a
fruitarian diet, is almost entirely free from all bacteria;
and their infection and action upon the system would
consequently be rendered practically impossible. There
would be no danger of infection if the body were maintained
in a high state of health—as it would be upon a
fruitarian diet.</p>

<p>Frequently, throughout this book, I have referred
to man’s “natural diet,” and, it may be asked, what is
his natural diet, in what does it consist? I answer:
fruit and nuts—or a combination of these—is man’s
natural diet, and this is proved by all the arguments
of comparative anatomy, of physiology, and all the
other evidences I have adduced. I think there can be
no mistake and no hesitation about this, once we have
mastered and appreciated the force of these arguments.
They alone would determine the issue. But, further,
I think there is one simple test that will settle this
question—an instinctive test. After eating a full meal
of any article of food, let a man look back, and contemplate
having to eat it all over again, and he can soon
tell whether what he has eaten is “natural” for him or
not! If the meal has consisted of fish and meat, and
all the other “luxuries” of modern civilisation, there
can be no doubt that such a thought would repulse and
sicken him; the very idea of it would nauseate him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>235</span>
But if the meal had consisted of peaches and dates,
let us say, the idea of going back and eating as much
again of the same food would not prove in the slightest
degree repellent to him. This instinctive testimony is
very suggestive and valuable, it appears to me, and
clearly indicates man’s natural diet.</p>

<p>Let us consider this question of instinct further.</p>

<p>If we take a little child into a room in which there are
two tables, one covered with meats of all kinds (choicely
cooked, if you will) and the other groaning under a
multitude of fruit, which one would the child turn to,
without any hesitation? Most certainly he would turn
to the table spread with fruit—in every single instance
where the appetite has not been perverted so early as
to render all natural taste and instinct impossible.
The child would turn to its natural food—fruit, and
would in that manner demonstrate his natural cravings
and instinct, and clearly indicate that his natural food
is fruit, and that consequently he is frugivorous by
nature. But now let us take a dog or a cat, or a lion
or a tiger into the room, and leave him there. To which
table would <i>he</i> turn, and that without a moment’s
hesitation? We can have no doubt on that point.
He would instantaneously show his carnivorous nature
and appetite, and would not, in all probability, even
touch the fruits, even if he were hungry and there was
no meat in the room at all. Our primary instincts,
therefore, clearly indicate that man is frugivorous, and
not carnivorous in his nature.</p>

<p>Again, if man were naturally carnivorous, he should
eat his meat as do the carnivora—and he should be
provided by nature with the bodily structure, teeth,
claws, etc., for doing so. Were man naturally carnivorous,
he should prey upon his food by night; he should
lurk in the dark places, and pounce upon his rightful
prey, rending it with his teeth, tearing it with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>236</span>
claws, lapping the warm blood as it oozes from the lifeless
body before him! He should catch and eat his
prey as do all the other (naturally) carnivorous animals.
If Nature pointed us to such a diet, we should feel the
same instinctive appetite for raw flesh as we now feel
for ripe fruit; and a slaughter-house would be more
delightful to us than an orchard. Yet we know that
such is not the case, and that even the mere thought of
such a thing is sickening to any sensitive person. Why
is this? Does it not clearly indicate that man is not
naturally carnivorous by nature, but that he can only
tolerate the idea of flesh-eating because of long deadening
of the higher moral centres, in this direction; and
because the food is so pickled, and spiced, and peppered,
and salted, and roasted, and fried, and smothered in
onions, and in other ways covered up and <i>concealed</i>, and
its taste and nature so <i>disguised</i>, that we can eat it at all?</p>

<p>As Mr Salt so well remarked<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our innate horror of bloodshed—a horror which
only long custom can deaden, and which, in spite of past
centuries of violence, is so powerful at the present time—is
proof that we are not naturally adapted for a sanguinary
diet; and, as has often been pointed out, it is
only by delegating to others the detested work of
slaughter, and by employing cookery to conceal the
uncongenial truth, that thoughtful persons can tolerate
the practice of meat-eating.”</p></div>

<p>If all persons who enjoy “a good, juicy beef-steak,”
or a rasher of bacon, first had to go out and kill the cow
or the hog, how do you think they would like it? And
how many of us would or could do such a thing?
Aside from the fact, before pointed out, that, were we
naturally carnivorous by nature, we should eat our flesh
warm and bleeding and quivering—as do the other carnivora—there
is this additional objection, that, even if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>237</span>
this were not the case, we must ever entail the duty to
others of killing the animal for us—so disgusting is the
very idea of dipping our hands and mouths in blood
before and during each meal!</p>

<p>Granting, then, that fruits and nuts can supply us
with all the essentials for the upbuilding of a healthy
body, and that this is man’s natural diet—the question
arises: How would it be best to break away from the
old foods, and adopt this simpler dietary? Certainly
this should not be done at once, in the majority of cases.
Many persons can pass from one diet to another instantaneously,
with no harm, but with decided benefit.
My own case is an example of this. Once I was
thoroughly persuaded that this was the ideal diet, I
dropped meat at one meal, and lived upon fruits and
nuts the next, and thenceforward from that day. I
never experienced any ill effects from such an abrupt
change, but only benefit. Though, at the present time,
I pay no attention, practically, to exercise, to breathing,
or to any of the other thought-to-be-essentials of the
physical culture life (I claim that all of these measures
can be practically dispensed with, if only the diet be
regulated carefully) I am always more or less in condition,
and I may fairly say that I never knew anyone
who could work more continuously and steadily for
so many hours at a stretch, and for so many days
together, as can I. Of course this is only one person’s
testimony, and hence my own method might not be
suited to all equally well. But I have introduced this
personal item to show that the old dogma that one
cannot make abrupt changes in the diet without detriment
to oneself is all pure nonsense. I never experienced
any ill effects whatever—and no more have
numerous other persons of my acquaintance, who have
adopted the fruitarian diet as abruptly as I did.</p>

<p>But, granting that this abrupt change is not desired,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>238</span>
what then? In that case, I should advise the patient
to leave off meat at one of his meals (if he has been in
the habit of eating it more than once a day) and substitute
eggs for it—in the morning or evening—or beans,
peas, cheese, etc., at noon. Let him get accustomed
to this change before another step is taken. Then,
abolish meat altogether from the bill of fare, and live
on the ordinary vegetarian foods for a few days. Next,
decrease the amount of cooked vegetables, and increase
the quantity of the fruits. Remember the advice
previously given regarding food combinations here.
It will soon be found that an egg or two, and a couple
of slices of bread, or a simple vegetarian dish, will supply
all the wants, for the first half of the meal; and this
should be followed by an abundant allowance of fruits.
Keep this up until the patient has grown thoroughly
accustomed to the change, and then (preferably in hot
weather) let him try his first meal of fruits, nuts and
whole-wheat bread and nut-butter. Later on, these
last articles may be abolished, if desired; but most
persons find it almost harder to give up their bread and
butter than they do their meat! The patient is now
fairly on the diet, and additional alterations and
restrictions are merely a matter of time. Doubtless
by this time he is sufficiently interested in the question
himself, and sufficiently delighted in his altered physical
condition, to need but little persuasion, and will gladly
adopt and follow the diet himself.</p>

<small>FOOD COMBINATIONS</small></h2></div>


<p>There are very few foods which, if eaten singly, would
be found to disagree. Most of the trouble arises when
we combine the various foods which do not suit or
harmonise; and the result is, distress and a complication
of disorders, due to the bad combination of such
foods. Such foods disagree with one another, so to
speak, rather than with us. This question of food
combinations is one which has been very largely overlooked,
but it is a highly important one, nevertheless.
Most people have never paid any attention to the
relative proportion of their foods, or thought how each
would combine with the other; and it is largely due
to this lack of foresight that so much dyspepsia is
present, and that so many digestive troubles are active
throughout the world. The motto of the average
individual would seem to be, “Out of sight, out of
mind”; but it must be remembered that, while the
stomach <i>receives</i> the food, the body has to <i>retain</i> it;
and long digestive processes, involving an enormous
outlay of energy, and many and complicated chemical
changes, have to be gone through, before food is appropriable
by the system. Of course, the tendency
among civilised peoples is in the direction of increasing
the number of articles of food at each meal, instead of
decreasing it. They like to see the table spread with a
litter of dishes, while a fifteen-course dinner is supposed
to be the height of luxury! Were the processes of
living considered a little more from the physiological,
and a little less from the gormandising point of view,
such would not be the case. The tendency would then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>240</span>
be (at least among all intelligent people), to <i>reduce</i>
the number of dishes, as much as possible—limiting
them at each meal to three or two, or even one.</p>

<p>Food should be solid. The digestive juices are
fluids, and an excess of liquid, with the food, tends
to dilute these gastric juices, and consequently to interfere
with their converting action. If fluids be drunk
with any meal they will dilute the power of concentrated
action of the gastric juice, and other digestive juices;
and will, further, have a tendency to wash the food
through the stomach into the intestines before it has
undergone proper stomach-digestion. Water, therefore,
should not be drunk <i>at</i> meals, but shortly before, or an
hour or so afterwards. In this way the requisite
amount of fluid is supplied to the system, without interfering
with digestion in the manner indicated.</p>

<p>Another result of drinking at meals is to prevent
thorough mastication of the foods. When these are
dry, they should be thoroughly insalivated before being
swallowed, for any liquid taken at the time softens
these foods artificially, and will also cause more food
to be eaten than would be the case, were it eaten
dry.</p>

<p>Dr Latson, in his “Food Value of Meat,” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fresh fruits all combine well with one another. As
a rule fruits, fresh or cooked, combine well with bread
or cooked cereals, and with nuts or nuts foods. Fruits
do not, as a rule, combine well with cooked vegetables,
nor with meat, eggs, cheese, milk, or cream. Milk
and cream are so liable to decomposition that, if only
for that reason, they are not desirable foods. Milk
or cream with cereals, fruit, sugar, or cooked vegetables
is apt to cause difficulty.... In arranging meals
in which flesh-meat is not to be included, it is only
necessary to remember that the nuts and the legumes
(peas, beans and lentils) contain the same food elements
as flesh-meat, and may always be eaten in its place with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>241</span>
advantage.... The best breakfast is one that consists
of fresh ripe fruit, and nothing else. To this may
be added, if desired, whole-wheat bread, or some cereal.
The cereal may be served with fruit juice.”</p></div>

<p>The following are a few sample meals arranged,
according to merit—only those foods being taken which
will combine well together.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Breakfast No. 1.</i>—Raw fruit, cereal with fruit juice,
whole-wheat bread.</p>

<p><i>Breakfast No. 2.</i>—Stewed apples, whole-wheat bread.</p>

eggs, whole-wheat bread.</p></div>

<p>The following are one or two sample luncheons:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Luncheon No. 1.</i>—Stewed fruit, nuts or nut-butter,
whole-wheat bread.</p>

<p><i>Luncheon No. 2.</i>—Peanut purée, boiled rice (or baked
potatoes), stewed fruit, whole-wheat bread.</p>

<p><i>Luncheon No. 3.</i>—Salad of any kind, garnished with
olive oil and lemon juice; fresh fruit and whole-wheat
bread.</p></div>

<p>The following are a few sample dinners:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dinner No. 1.</i>—Fresh fruit, salad, macaroni, whole-wheat

<p>Dr William S. Sadler<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> gives the following directions
as to food combinations:—</p>

<div class="small">
<p class= "center"><span class="smcap">Good Combinations</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Fruits and grains</li>
<li>Grains and meat or eggs</li>

<ul>
<li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Milk and vegetables</li>
<li>Sour fruits and milk</li>
<li>Milk and meat</li>
</ul></div>


<p>Mr and Mrs Christian, in their “Uncooked Foods”
(p. 63), give three elaborate meals, composed of uncooked
foods entirely, though it will be seen that their
grouping of combinations is not so strict as that formulated
above. The meals are as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Breakfast.</i>—One ripe apple, two ounces pecan meats,
six or eight black dates, one very ripe banana, sliced
with thick cream, one glass milk.</p>

<p>“<i>Luncheon.</i>—Two bartlett pears, one ounce pecan
meats, three Turkish pulled figs, one ounce pignolias,
cold slaw with olive oil, one cake of unfired bread, four
prunes with thick cream, sweet butter, egg-nog.</p>

<p>“<i>Dinner.</i>—Half pound of grapes, two ounces mixed
nut meats, vegetable salad with dressing, one cake unfired
bread, cream cheese, six or eight black dates, one
very ripe red banana, with thick cream, pint of whole
milk.”</p></div>

<p>Personally, I think that the above combinations are
by no means ideal, and in addition to that, far too much
in bulk has been prescribed for each meal. Were the
breakfast omitted, and but two meals daily eaten, the
amount prescribed would be more proportionate, but
even then I feel certain that the amount is greatly
in excess of bodily needs. The authors, however, have
made an extended study of food combinations, and,
in fact, are almost the only writers who have paid much
attention to this subject. In their chapter on food
combinations, they say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>243</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“The following combinations have been found by
experience to be chemically harmonious, healthful, and
very nutritious:—</p>

<p>“Flaked wheat, with nuts, dates and cream.</p>

<p>“Flaked wheat, nuts, honey, milk and cream.</p>

<p>“Egg-nog, pecan meats, dates, banana and cream.</p>

<p>“Cold slaw with olive oil, pecan meats, unfired bread,
sweet apple with thick cream.</p>

<p>“All foods composed largely of starch, such as cereals,
potatoes, and nearly all legumes, should not be eaten
at the same meal with sweets, especially cane sugar.
All foods, whether fluids or solids, that contain starch
or sugar, such as rice, potatoes, corn, oats, in fact all
the cereal class may be eaten with safety at the same
meal. Milk can also be taken with all the carbohydrate
family of foods.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> All foods containing gluten,
albumen, or gelatine, such as meat, eggs and a few kinds
of nuts, are classed as protein, and require an acid
solvent to be digested. Therefore, they can be eaten
with safety with all kinds of fruits. Milk, one of the
best foods known, can be taken with all kinds of fruits,
provided no cereal starch be eaten at the same meal.
All foods that contain both carbohydrates and protein
compose healthful combinations.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></div>

<p>In balancing any dietary, care must be taken, of
course, to keep the relative proportion of proteids,
fats and carbohydrates, equal; and to see, also, that
the proper amount of mineral salts is contained in all
the foods; also that a due supply of water is furnished
to the system. One of the chief causes of failure on the
part of those who leave off meat, and attempt to take
up vegetarianism, is that they do not rightly balance
their diet, and do not supply to the system the proper
amount of proteid food, to take the place of that which
the meat supplied. Vegetarians, as a rule, eat far <i>too
much</i> food. Under the impression that they must eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>244</span>
more, in order to offset the supposed greater “nutritive”
value of the meat which they have given up,
they eat far more than they should: while as a matter
of fact, the vegetarian foods are richer and far more
nutritious than the ordinary mixed diet. Consequently,
less, instead of more, should be eaten. Anyone
leaving off his meat must expect to feel a certain depression
for a few days, as before pointed out—owing
to the fact that the stimulating quality of the meat is
withdrawn; but, those few days once past, a general
invigoration of the system will be noted. Due attention
should be paid to all hygienic auxiliaries, and an excess
of food should by all means be avoided. Substitute
eggs, cheese, peas, beans, lentils and nuts for the meat
formerly eaten; in other ways pay attention to the
balancing of the diet, and no inconvenience will be
experienced, as a result of leaving off meat and adopting
the newer dietary.</p>

<p>Dr Susana Dodds, in her “Health in the Household,
or Hygienic Cookery,” says, in writing of food combinations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is folly to overlook the fact that there is a certain
fitness or adaptation to be observed both in the selection
and classification of foods which enhances their
value as a whole; it will not do to huddle them together
indiscriminately, either on one’s palate or on the stomach;
baked beans and grape-juice are both very satisfactory
in themselves; but they have so little in common that
no one would think of eating them together; though
the harm resulting from so injurious a combination would
be more apparent in some cases than in others. Nearly
half a century of close contact with invalids has placed
before the hygienic physician certain <i>facts</i> which cannot
be ignored; and whether the signs behind them are
fully understood or not, the facts themselves remain.
For example, if we have a nervous dyspeptic to treat,
we know better than to set before him at one and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>245</span>
same meal strawberries, and beets, or strawberries and
cabbage, or apples (raw or cooked) and sweet potatoes,
or apples and beans. These are only examples of at
least fifty combinations which could be made, any one
of which would give a weak stomach indigestion....
Sweet potatoes and tomatoes make a good combination
and one very acceptable to most persons—the one being
sweet the other acid, the one highly nutritious, the other
decidedly juicy.”</p></div>

<p>To those who have not made this subject a study the
following hints may be of practical use, though in many
things it is next to impossible to lay down definite rules.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>1. Fruits and vegetables should not, as a rule, be
eaten together—that is, at the same meal. If they are so
eaten, persons with feeble digestive organs will suffer.</p>

<p>2. If vegetables are eaten, the noonday meal is the
best time to take them, two or three varieties being
quite sufficient. Tomatoes do well with vegetables,
grains, or meats; but they should not, as a rule, be
eaten with fruits.</p>

<p>3. The Irish potato seems to be an exception among
vegetables; it is so unaggressive in its nature that it
seldom quarrels with anything. It may therefore be
eaten (by most persons) with <i>either</i> fruits or vegetables;
and it always does well with grains.</p>

<p>4. Fruits and cereals are particularly suited to the
morning and evening meals; and very little other food
is required.</p>

<p>5. A good rule, when suppers are eaten, is to make the
meal of bread and fruit only, these being taken in limited
quantities and at an early hour.</p>

<p>6. Fruits, if eaten raw, should be ripe, and of good
quality; and persons with feeble stomachs digest them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>246</span>
more easily at the beginning of the meal; this is particularly
true when warm fruits make a part of the
repast.</p>

<p>7. Fruits, raw or cooked, may be eaten at dinner, provided
no vegetable (unless it be the potato) be taken.
But if raw, they should be eaten <i>first</i>, particularly if
there are warm foods to follow.</p>

<p>8. Some persons cannot digest certain kinds of raw
fruits for supper, or late in the day; let them take these
on sitting down to the breakfast-table; or the first
thing at dinner, unless there are <i>vegetables</i> at this meal.</p>

<p>9. If meats “must be” eaten—take them at the
noonday meal, with or without vegetables; and in cold
weather, rather than warm.</p>

<p>10. The grains digest well with all other foods;
though some persons cannot eat them in the form of
mushes. They should always be thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>11. Persons with feeble digestions should as a rule
confine themselves to a <i>single kind</i> of fruit at a meal;
they can make the changes from one meal to another.</p>

<p>12. Those who find it difficult to digest vegetables
should not attempt more than one kind at a given meal,
until the digestion is improved. And often it is best
to leave them off entirely for a time.</p>

<p>13. In selecting vegetables for a single meal, do not,
if there are several varieties, have all of them of the
watery or juicy kinds, as cabbage, asparagus, white
turnips, etc.; nor all of the drier sorts, such as baked
beans, winter squashes, sweet potatoes, etc.; but blend
the more and less nutritious kinds in a judicious manner.
Or if you have only the watery ones at hand, be content
with not more than two varieties; prepare a side dish of
something <i>rather</i> nutritious, and then add a dish of warm
corn bread, as an accompaniment, particularly if it be
a cold day.</p>

<p>14. If you have for dinner a thin vegetable soup,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>247</span>
follow with something more substantial, as baked beans,
baked potatoes (sweet or Irish) or corn bread; but if
you have bean or split-pea soup, let the other vegetables
be of a kind less hearty.</p>

<p>15. On a very cold day have a warm dinner of good
nutritious articles; select mainly solid foods with
grains, rather than thin soups and watery vegetables.</p>

<p>16. On a warm day make the breakfast largely of
fruits, with a moderate supply of cereals. The dinner
may be of young vegetables (or fruits), a dish of grains,
if you like, and a little bread. Eat lightly, and you will
suffer less from heat—particularly if no seasonings are
taken. For supper, a glass of cold grape juice, and a
slice of loaf bread, is excellent in hot weather.</p>

<p>17. In very cold weather take the chill off your stewed
fruit, fruit pies, or other dishes, before serving them.
Pastries, if used, are best at the noonday meal—and so
are puddings.</p>

<p>18. If there are invalids at the table, they should eat
nothing that is very cold; food not much below blood
heat is best, particularly in cold weather; and the dining-room
should be comfortably warm.</p>

<p>19. Never have too great a variety at a single meal;
have few dishes well prepared, and make the changes
from one meal to another; this will please better on
the whole, and it will not too rapidly exhaust your
limited supplies.</p>

<p>20. If one meal happens to fall a little below the average
in either quality or variety, see that the next is fully
up to the mark.</p>

<p>The evil results which follow bad food combinations
may be summed up in a very few words. We know
that certain chemical elements, acting upon one another,
will form resultant gases. Various food substances
that do not properly combine, will form such gases in
precisely the same way; and these will be largely ab<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>248</span>sorbed
by the blood, and carried to the cells throughout
the body, which they poison, more or less, in consequence.
The harmful results of these poisonous gases,
absorbed in this manner, are particularly noticeable in
their effect upon the various nerve centres—producing
an inhibitory effect upon them, and inducing that general
condition of weariness and debility experienced and
noticed under the host of symptoms known to us as
nervous exhaustion, fatigue, lassitude, etc., etc. The
simple and obvious method that should be followed in
all such cases, in order to eliminate these poisons
from the system, is to abstain from food until the system
has had a chance to eliminate such toxic substances.
This once accomplished, the system being freed from
the ashes of previously mal-assimilated food material,
and a fresh supply of oxygen being furnished, by continued
breathing, in the interval, the system will soon
return to its normal condition of health, and will enjoy
a higher standard of energy and vitality than has been
the case for some considerable time in the past.</p>

<small>HYGIENIC FOODS AND HYGIENIC COOKERY</small></h2></div>


<p>In discussing this question of foods and food values and
constituents, we must be very careful to keep clear in
the mind the distinction between <i>proximate</i> elements,
or foods proper, and <i>chemical</i> or <i>ultimate</i> elements.
This is very important. All alimentary substances are
composed of certain constituent parts, which may be
properly called alimentary principles. These are formed
by certain combinations of elementary constituents,
which are denominated chemical elements. Thus
wheat, beef, potato, apple, etc., are aliments, or foods
proper; and starch, sugar, rum, fibrin, albumen, gelatin,
etc.—their constituents—are proximate elements.
Proximate elements of food are compounds of the simple
or chemical elements; and aliments or foods proper
are compounds of the proximate principles.</p>

<p>It is important to keep these distinctions in mind,
because the human body can be nourished and retain
its health upon organic combinations of proximate
elements, while it would starve to death on the ultimate
elements administered in exactly the same proportions.
Dogs have been fed on sugar, gum, starch, butter, fat,
fibrin, albumen, etc., exclusively, and with the uniform
result that they sooner or later starved to death! No
animal can sustain prolonged nutrition on any single
alimentary principle, though all of them may on a single
aliment.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, a food is nutritious, and
capable of sustaining life, in proportion to its complexity.
The more simple the food, the less it is capable of sustaining
life and health. This does not mean that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>250</span>
large <i>number of foods</i> should be eaten at one meal—in
order to supply this lack—since nearly all foods, or a
reasonable admixture of them—contain all the essentials
for sustaining life in a state of health and vigour.
Certain foods—nuts, <i>e.g.</i>—seem to contain about all
the essentials and in exactly the right proportions.
I have discussed this aspect of the question in the
chapter on the fruitarian diet.</p>

<p>One very important fact may be mentioned here.
Animals cannot appropriate mineral or inorganic
elements <i>directly</i>; they must obtain all these substances
through or by means of the vegetable world.
Vegetables have the power of utilising these inorganic
materials, and build them into their bodies; but animals
have to obtain all such substances in an organised form—<i>i.e.</i>
organic materials—and cannot possibly utilise
the <i>in</i>organic elements. Thus, if an animal requires
iron, it cannot eat iron filings, to supply this need,
but must take it in the form of spinach, and cabbage,
and fruits containing large quantities of iron; he
cannot possibly eat it in its mineral form. The
vegetable world, on the contrary, has the power of
building these mineral elements into its structure.
Vegetables feed upon minerals, and animals upon vegetables;
and this order cannot be reversed. It will
thus be seen that the vegetable world is that designed for
man’s food; and from it he should derive all his nourishment.
Certainly he can derive no part of it from the
<i>mineral</i> world.</p>

<p><i>Hints on Hygienic Cookery.</i>—While I believe that the
ideal diet is that which is uncooked—or sun-cooked—nevertheless
some foods are best cooked, if the ordinary
vegetarian diet is to be adhered to. Thus, grains when
uncooked are but slightly nutritious, a large portion of
their starch remaining unconverted; but when cooked
this is converted into dextrine, and thus rendered more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>251</span>
appropriable by the system. Cooking is therefore
justified, if vegetable foods and grains are to be eaten;
and I propose, accordingly, to jot down a few notes and
instructions which will, I believe, be found useful to
all those who wish to reform their food habits, to a
certain extent, and cook as hygienically as possible.
I shall not attempt any elaborate outline of hygienic
cookery in this place; several of the vegetarian cookbooks
on the market go into great detail on these
questions, and I shall therefore confine myself to a few
brief notes.</p>

<p>Bread should be well cooked, and the crusts thoroughly
baked brown. It had best be baked in a <i>closed</i> pan.
Bread should, of course, always be made from whole-wheat
flour—never white flour. Salt is never necessary.
Trall has given numerous recipes for wholesome bread-making—in
some of them no other ingredients are used
but flour, water, and air! And they are sweet, excellent
breads too.</p>

<p>All pastries should be made quickly, and with very
little kneading. Have the oven ready before this
kneading is commenced. Roll the crust thin, and see
that the bottom crust of a pie is browned before adding
the fruit and the top crust.</p>

<p>Vegetables—nearly all of them—should be dropped
into boiling, not cold, water, and should be cooked
rapidly. The purpose of this is to coagulate and condense
the outer rind or layer of the vegetable, and thus
prevent the juices and valuable food properties from
boiling out, into the water. The same is true of all
meats, when these are fried or grilled.</p>

<p>If fruits are cooked at all, green fruits should be
selected in preference to over-ripe fruits—which should
be cooked but little. Unripe fruits should be started
in <i>cold</i> water, and cooked slowly. All grains are best
steamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>252</span></p>

<p>Sugar added to fruits renders them sweet-tasting, but
liable to fermentation. The ordinary sugar on the
market is open to many objections. Numerous
hygienists will not use it at all, and if fruits are found
to be a trifle sour, or need sweetening, they use dates
instead.</p>

<p>See that all currants, raisins and dried fruits are
thoroughly clean before cooking them. In the summer
months especially they are liable to contain insects,
and these should be washed off before the fruits are
placed on the fire to cook—otherwise they will be cooked
with them!</p>

<p>If soda is put into bread, etc., use it sparingly. Salt
need never be used. One can soon get accustomed
to food without a particle of salt or other dressing; and,
once the normal taste is acquired, salt, pepper, etc.,
will never again be desired or craved.</p>

<p><i>Meat as an Article of Diet.</i>—I have advanced reasons,
throughout this book, for thinking that meat is by no
means a suitable article of food, but is, on the contrary,
extremely pernicious in its effects upon the system.
The reasons for this are given in full elsewhere. At the
same time, I am disposed to think that a <i>limited</i> amount
of meat is not so harmful, frequently, as a larger amount
of other foods—fine flour, cake, pickles, sauces, etc. A
large quantity of any of these, long continued, will tend
to ruin the body more effectually than a limited quantity
of meat, and hence are to be more strictly avoided.
Nevertheless, I consider meat a highly stimulating and
unwholesome article of diet, for the reasons given
above, and should strongly advise other foods in its
place, whenever possible.</p>

<p>If the reader feels that he <i>must</i> eat meat, however, let
him be sure (or as sure as he can be) that the meat is fresh,
and is not diseased. Two great dangers are avoided in
this way. The animals which are to be eaten should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>253</span>
fed on the cleanest of food, and should have plenty of
pure water to drink; they should never be kept in
confined places, in a vitiated atmosphere, or in filthy
surroundings. They need plenty of exercise. The
animal should be killed in a sanitary manner, and kept
clean and free from contamination after it is killed.
The meat should be put on ice at once, and, needless
to say, no chemicals or other drugs injected into the
tissues.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton are doubtless two of the best meats
which can be eaten. The diet of these animals is the
cleanest; and their tissues should be the “cleanest,”
in consequence. Beef is, of course, the most widely
eaten of all meats; and, more than that, we feed
upon or utilise almost every conceivable part of the
animal. As Dr Brush so well said<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are veritable parasites on this animal. We
milk her as long as she will give milk, and we drink it;
then we kill her, and eat her flesh, blood, and most of
the viscera; we skin her, and clothe ourselves with her
skin; we comb our hair with her horns, and fertilise
our fields with her dung, while her calf furnishes us with
vaccine virus for the prevention of smallpox!”</p></div>

<p>Is it any wonder that we manage to contract some
of the diseases from which this animal suffers? The
only wonder is that we escape at all! The same thing
may be said in a lesser degree of mutton, veal, pork,
and, in fact, all the animal substances. They all
contain, along with a small amount of nutritive material,
a large amount of poisons and excreta.</p>

<p>When we come to pork, bacon, ham, etc., there is no
longer any excuse for the practice at all. If it is felt
that meat <i>must</i> be eaten, let it be clean meat, such
as beef or mutton, without turning to the pig for our
supply! Nothing so lacks excuse as this. Writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>254</span>
upon the practice of pork-eating, in her “Diet
Question,” Dr Dodds says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The hog is a scavenger by nature, and by practice;
it is his proper mission on this earth, not to be eaten,
but to eat up that which the nobler animals disdain to
touch. Indeed, he adapts himself to circumstances,
devouring whatever comes in his way. He is equally
well pleased with the clean ears of corn, or with the
seething contents of the swill pail; he will dine on live
chickens or devour carrion. Nothing is too fine or too
foul to suit his undiscriminating palate; he has been
called ‘the scavenger-in-chief of all the back-boned
animals.’ Truly he is omnivorous....</p>

<p>“Will anyone give an intelligent reason why people
should eat him, and from choice? If we must dine on
our fellow-creatures below us, are there not decent,
clean-feeding animals, as the ox, and the sheep, that we
could take in preference?</p>

<p>“From a sanitary point of view, the condition of the
hog, in his best estate, is not flattering. His scurvy hide
(which is perhaps the cleanest part of him), his foul
breath, and his filthy feeding habits—are not these
enough to bar him from our tables? Or must we wait
for such logical sequence as is sure to follow the violation
of physiological law? Wait till diseases are multiplied
in kind, and intensified in character, till we are
fairly driven from the no-longer questionable provender?
Wait till our nearest friend is stricken with supposed
typhoid fever, and dead of veritable trichinosis? There
can be no doubt that a number of persons have sickened
and a number died, of what was thought to be typhoid
fever, when really the disease was due to the presence
of these parasites (the trichinæ) in the system; for
the symptoms in the two diseases are quite similar.</p>

<p>“As stated in the last chapter, one of the principal
objections to the use of animal flesh as food, is the fact
that it is filled with the debris of the vital organism,
working its way through the capillaries into the various
excretions, and out of the domain of life. Now, if this
effete matter is objectionable, even in clean-feeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>255</span>
animals, what must be its condition as it is thrown off
from the tissues of scavengers? And what the nature
of the tissues themselves, when they are not only made
out of, and nourished by a diet of garbage, but are
thoroughly saturated with the almost putrescent
matters with which the venous blood is laden? It is
a fact that we seem rather slow to recognise, that the
quality of all animal tissues partakes of the character
of the materials out of which they are made. In other
words, if we expect sound bodies, with good firm tissues,
we must look to the nature of the food we eat....</p>

<p>“Nor is it enough that we devour the several parts of
the animal, even to his liver and kidneys; we strip the
intestines of their fat, melt it down, and use it in the
form of lard! This latter is the very quintessence of
the swine; it is the diseased product of all his filthy
feeding; and it is the article that forms a staple in
almost every American family. It shortens the biscuits,
the plain cakes, and the pastries; and it even
finds its way into the loaf bread. It oils the bake-pans,
it fries the drop-cakes, the doughnuts, the Saratoga
potatoes, and all the other ‘fried things,’ or nearly all.
In short, there is neither breakfast, dinner, nor supper
without it, in some form or other.</p>

<p>“Do the people wonder that they are afflicted with
scrofula; and that it crops out, full-fledged, in a single
generation? Oh, for a Moses among the Gentiles, to
forbid them, by legal enactment, the use of this vile
thing, swine’s flesh!”</p></div>

<p>Birds and game of all kinds are to be avoided. The
flesh of the goose, duck, etc., is very oily, greasy and
unwholesome. Chicken, turkey, etc., are somewhat
better, but their flesh is not nearly so nutritious as beef
and mutton, while the amount of poisons they contain
is certainly equal to the latter. It must be remembered
that these animals are frequently confined and artificially
fed, in order to “fatten” them for the market;
and even when this has not been done, the birds have
very rarely sufficient room to exercise as they ought to,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>256</span>
and their food and water supply is by no means what
it should be. Of course, when artificial feeding has
been employed, their flesh is little short of poisonous.
The “fat” noticed and so highly praised is merely
retained filth and excreta, and should be outside the
animal’s body, and not in it. Needless to say, the
flesh of all such birds should be eschewed.</p>

<p>Fish is considered by some to be a very fine article
of diet—being nutritious and easily digested. For
that reason, it is often given to invalids! Where such
a curious hallucination could have arisen it is hard
to see. Its flesh is exceedingly gross, tough, fibrous,
and contains but little nutriment. The flesh of all
animals partakes more or less of the nature of their
diet; and fish and fowl are certainly not the cleanest
of feeders! Their flesh is in no sense superior to that
of the cow or sheep; but is, on the contrary, distinctly
<i>inferior</i>. All shellfish are unclean articles of diet—they
being merely the scavengers of the sea; and should
be avoided most carefully. They are exceedingly
indigestible, and frequently the cause of skin disease,
on the one hand, and of ptomaine poisoning, on the
other.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to say that all internal
organs of animals are to be avoided! Not only for the
reason that a large number of the animals found on the
market are diseased; but also because all these organs
are merely <i>depurating</i> organs, should they be eschewed.
If any person were to consider for one minute the
<i>function</i> of the liver or the kidneys, it is more than
probable that he would not touch them! During
the whole of the animal’s life, they have been merely
<i>filters</i> for the filth and excreta which passed through its
body; they were the great reservoirs of poisons and
toxins of all sorts! The idea of eating such offal
should be repellant to any sensitive, even sensible, mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>257</span></p>

<p><i>Soups.</i>—But little need be said of soups. As a
whole, they may be said to be lacking in every
essential which is necessary in order to recommend them
as suitable articles for human diet. Meat soups,
broths, beef teas, etc., we have already discussed.
They are practically stimulants, and consist of water,
and poisonous excreta in solution! They contain no
fats, carbohydrates or salts of value, and but very
little proteid. Vegetable soups have somewhat more
to recommend them, but <i>all</i> soups are open to the prime
objection that they are invariably eaten without
mastication, and hence are taken into the stomach
in a condition totally unsuited for the initial stages
of digestion—which the stomach is called upon to
perform. It must be remembered, in this connection,
that mastication is not only for the purpose of dividing
the food into small particles, so that the gastric and
intestinal juices may act upon them, but also, that
important <i>chemical changes</i> take place in the mouth—starch
being converted into dextrine, etc. Soups
are always swallowed without this initial process.
Further, the large amount of water they contain renders
them unsuitable food for the adult—whose food should
be less in quantity and more solid in quality; and any
liquid which is supplied during the process of digestion
by way of solvent and dilutant should be the digestive
juices only. <i>Jellies</i> are of very low nutritive value,
and should never be administered to invalids. Animals
fed on jelly die as soon as if they were not fed at all.
In her “Notes on Nursing,” Miss Florence Nightingale
contends very strongly against the use of jellies of any
kind, and finds it difficult to select words strong enough
to suit her antipathy to jellies.</p>

<p><i>Puddings, Pies, etc.</i>—It is now all but universally
admitted that these articles of diet are indigestible—rich,
greasy, and objectionable in many ways.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>258</span>
The usual crust which is bought is made of white flour,
in the first place, while the grease contained is a poor
quality of lard. As animal food, this is certainly objectionable;
lard being a filthy article of diet in any case.
The sugar, flour, grease, and all the other ingredients
used are generally harmful, and exceedingly indigestible.
All the constituents can be supplied in a pure form in
other foods. The fruit is the best thing contained in
such pies, etc.; and this is spoiled by being cooked,
and is also covered with spices and nutmeg, etc.,
which offset all its original value, and spoil its
flavour to all educated palates. As usually presented,
such foods have nothing to recommend them.</p>

<p>Still, as Dr Trall said<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>: “the crust for pies and tarts
may be made comparatively wholesome in a variety of
ways. Any kind of flour or meal, or various admixtures
of them, may be wet with water and shortened with
sweet cream, or the flour or meal may be wet with milk
and shortened with olive oil.” In this book, and in
various others, may be found a number of recipes for
making bread, pies, puddings, etc., in the hygienic style.
I shall not discuss this aspect of the question in the
present work, which is devoted more to the philosophy
of diet than the details of cooking—especially since I
am recommending no cooking at all! However, there
is doubtless a right and a wrong way to do everything;
and if people continue to feel that they <i>must</i> have breads
and pies, they might as well have them made as hygienically
as possible. There is no reason why such foods
should be indigestible or innutritious, if properly made.
It need hardly be said that all hot breads, buckwheat
cakes, etc., should be sedulously avoided.</p>

<p><i>Sugar.</i>—Hygienists have no objection to the use of
saccharine matter, provided it is taken in the natural
way—that is, in organic combination with other food<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>259</span>
principles—not separated as a proximate element.
Sugar contained in fruits, grains, vegetables, etc., are
thoroughly wholesome; but an excess of sugar of the
ordinary sort, as bought upon the market, is very detrimental.
Particularly is this the case when the sugar
is not rightly combined with other articles of food.
We have discussed this at greater length, however,
when considering “food combinations.” Miss Mary
H. Abel, in her pamphlet, “Sugar as Food,” published
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Within certain limits we can look upon sugar as the
equivalent of starch that has been digested and made
ready for absorption, A mealy, boiled potato, or a
lump of laundry starch, is, in fact, very akin to a lump
of sugar; and the potato, like all forms of starchy food,
must be turned into a kind of sugar by the digestive
juices before it can be absorbed as food by the system....
The main function of sugar, as found in the blood,
whether resulting from the digestion of sugar or of starch,
is believed to be the production of heat and energy.
The proof has been amply furnished by experiment.
By ingenious devices, the blood going to and from the
muscle of a living animal, may be analysed, and it is
thus shown that more blood traverses an active or
working muscle, and more sugar disappears from it
than is the case with the muscle at rest.”</p></div>

<p>While the system needs sugar, this should not be
supplied in the form of the common beet sugar upon the
market—since this is adulterated in various ways, and
contains, in addition to the saccharine elements, much
inert, mineral matter. Sugar in its pure form, however,
is a very important article of diet—far more important,
probably, than has hitherto been acknowledged. Not
only are starches, etc., converted into sugar in the
process of digestion, but it has frequently been noted
that when a lesser amount of proteid is consumed, a
proportionately larger amount of sugar is craved.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>260</span>
Mr Horace Fletcher noticed this in his diet experiments,
and stated that, as the appetite for meat decreased,
that for sugar increased—which is a very significant
remark. If the saccharine elements in the food-supply
were increased, there can be little doubt that there
would be a decreased consumption of meat and all
proteid matters. The craving of children for sweets is
to be looked upon, <i>not</i> as a morbid appetite, but as a
physiological craving of the organism. In saying that
this appetite should be gratified, however, I do not mean
that unlimited quantities of sweets and sweet-stuffs,
as found upon the market, are to be allowed the child,
but a greater proportion of sweet-stuffs should be
allowed in the form of sweet fruits—such as dates, figs,
etc. Administered in this way, sugar will be found a
highly valuable article of diet.</p>

<p><i>Tea, Coffee and Other Stimulants.</i>—Most persons know,
I should imagine, that none of these drinks are suitable
for the human stomach. In the first place, no drink at
all should be taken at meals, but only between meals;
the reason for this being that the digestive juices are
unduly diluted and the food is washed through the
stomach, and into the bowels, before it is properly
digested, when water or any liquid is drunk at mealtimes.
All drinks should, therefore, be between meals,
and not for at least an hour after a meal, if we wish to
ensure the best digestion of the foods eaten.</p>

<p>If this is true of water, the best of all drinks, it
is certainly far more true of tea, coffee, and all
other stimulants taken at meals. Not only are the
effects detrimental (in that they are liquids), but they
are of themselves more or less direct poisons also. Tea
contains a poison known as <i>theine</i>, which corresponds to
a similar poison contained in coffee, and known as
<i>caffeine</i>. Both are strong poisons. Half a gram
causes a quick pulse, nervous excitement, slight de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>261</span>lusions,
and lastly a desire for sleep. Small doses cause
sleeplessness, irritability of the bladder and bowels,
trembling of the extremities, and other signs of cerebral
and nervous distress. Both these poisons work havoc
with the system, ruining the nervous and mental life,
and creating a dependence on stimulants, which may
lead to alcoholic and other excesses. These poisons
ruin the taste buds, retard proper digestion, cause constipation,
and in many ways tend to ruin the constitution.
They cannot be too strongly deprecated.
Even <i>cocoa</i> contains injurious alkaloids, analogous to
those contained in tea and coffee, and for that reason is
to be avoided. Like all hot drinks, it tends to ruin the
taste buds and induce a desire for more food than is
needed, physiologically, and more than the system
really requires. For that reason, also, all such drinks
are to be avoided.</p>

<p>The injurious effects of <i>alcohol</i>, and all other similar
stimulants are now so widely known that it is unnecessary
to do more than refer to the fact here. Alcohol is
<i>never</i> necessitated, and is detrimental at all times—more
so at some times than at others. The widespread delusion
that alcohol is a food; and, on the other hand, the
idea that it actually furnishes “force” to the body, is
responsible for much of the abuse which exists. Alcohol
imparts no force and no energy to the system, but on
the contrary wastes and expends both. Were this once
thoroughly realised there would be no excuse whatever
for the administration of alcohol, or its use in any form.
But the injurious effects of alcohol have been discussed
so frequently that I shall not do more than refer to it.
(See the discussion of “Stimulants,” in my “Vitality,
Fasting and Nutrition,” pp. 34-44.)</p>

<p><i>Water.</i>—This is the beverage supplied by nature to
furnish all the liquid the body requires; and water in a
pure distilled state is contained in all vegetables, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>262</span>
and particularly in fruits. Fruitarians have often found
that they can live in good health for weeks and months
at a time without a drop of water—while keeping
closely to their fruitarian diet. Nevertheless, water is
very essential for the majority, and especially so upon
an ordinary “mixed” diet. It will be found as a general
rule that the more stimulating the food, the more water
is required; and the same is true of all greasy foods.
It is well known that all foods containing a large amount
of <i>salt</i> call for water—this being due to the demand of
the system for extra fluids, to wash out the offending
and irritating substance. This fact alone should show
us how harmful common salt is. The system clearly
tries to wash it out of the tissues as soon as possible.
Water containing any mineral substance in solution
should be avoided. It is never beneficial, but always
detrimental to the system. The mineral salts contained
are just as injurious as if they were procured from the
drug-shop, and taken in the usual way. Pure water is
the best at all times—there is but one simple rule to
follow in this connection: the purer, the better!
Water should never be drunk at meals, but always
between meals. It should be cool, but not ice cold.
Hot water may occasionally be of benefit. A plentiful
supply of water should be indulged in at all times.
The secretions will thereby be increased in volume,
the kidneys and liver stimulated into action, the blood
rendered less thick, and the general system invigorated.
I cannot speak too strongly in favour of large quantities
of water each day—say from one to two quarts—if
health is to be maintained. (This is of course on the
ordinary “mixed” diet.) In all diseased conditions,
the necessity for water is greatly increased, and the
body is frequently rendered sick because of the very
lack of it.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that water is the only article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>263</span>
which is taken into the system that is not digested—in
one sense of the term. All foods are digested, of course;
and even air goes through a process which might well be
called digestion. But water is not digested. It passes
through the stomach, and into the bowels unchanged;
it enters the system <i>as water</i>, and it leaves it <i>as water</i>,
and any changes which are noted are simply due to the
added salts and excreta which the water has washed
through the body along with it. Of itself, it has undergone
no change. This is a remarkable fact, and would
serve to indicate the tremendous cleansing and flushing
properties of water. Next to air, it is doubtless the most
necessary article which the body can appropriate. A
man can live sixty or more days on water (and air) without
solid food; but he can live only ten or twelve days
on solid food (and air) without water. It will thus be
seen that water is far <i>more</i> essential to life than is solid
food! It is of interest to note, also, that, in all hard
manual labour, water is invariably craved long before
solid food is called for by the tissues—<i>i.e.</i> thirst invariably
returns before hunger.</p>

<p><i>Air and Breathing.</i>—It is not generally known that
all air taken into the lungs is <i>digested</i>—in one sense of
the word—and that next to the last stage of all digestive
processes is carried on in the lungs. For that reason a
plentiful supply of fresh, pure air is so necessary. Every
book we pick up upon the question of health and
hygiene is most emphatic upon the value of fresh air;
but few tell us <i>why</i> it is so necessary. The majority of
persons know that a certain amount of oxygen is needed
by the system, and that the blood is purified as it passes
through the lungs, but they do not know that these
processes are only the first crude outlines of what takes
place, and that the processes carried on are both detailed
and complicated. Further, as I have said, one of the
stages of digestion is carried on in the lungs. The blood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>264</span>
stream carries the food material to the lungs, and there
it meets the oxygen of the atmospheric air, and becomes
oxidised, and rendered appropriable by the system.
It is important to bear in mind this important fact,
that, no matter how much food we may eat, if it is not
oxidised in this manner in the lungs, it cannot be
appropriated by the system, and for that reason remains
little better than refuse matter—floating at large
in the system. That is, suppose we eat two pounds of
food during the day, and breathe only enough (correspondingly)
to oxidise one pound, only one pound will
be utilised by the system, which will derive no benefit
whatever from the other pound—no matter how good
and nutritious the food may be! In fact, it will harm
it, by floating about, as mal-assimilated food material.
That is why deep breathing, and breathing fresh air
is so essential. Without this supply of air, food would
never nourish us, or be of any use whatever to the
system.</p>

<small>THE QUESTION OF QUANTITY</small></h2></div>


<p>I have discussed this question of the quantity of food
necessary for the human body so exhaustively in my
former book, “Vitality, Fasting and Nutrition,” that
I need say but little in this place, beyond re-emphasising
what I there said. I may, however, add one or two
further reflections that have arisen in my mind since
the publication of that book, and which may be of
interest to those who think about their food at all. This
book is devoted to the <i>quality</i> of the various foods, as
my last was devoted to the <i>quantity</i>; and the disproportionate
size of the two volumes rightly indicates
what I conceive to be the relative value or place of the
two—viz. errors in quality and errors in quantity. I
believe that, although errors in quality are tremendously
important, errors in quantity are vastly more so, and
that, as Dr Graham so well said, many years ago: “It
is as a general rule strictly true that a correct quantity
of a less wholesome aliment is better for man than an
excessively small or an excessively large quantity of a
more wholesome aliment.” So far as health and longevity
are concerned, therefore, it is incomparably better
for man to subsist on a correct quantity of vegetable
and animal food, properly prepared, than habitually
to indulge in an excessive quantity of pure vegetable
food of the best kind, and prepared in the best
manner; and the difference is still greater if the vegetable
food be badly prepared. And it is solely from
the want of a proper regard for this important truth,
that many have been unsuccessful in their attempts
to live exclusively upon a vegetarian diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>266</span></p>

<p>I have previously pointed out the harm that may
result to the body from an excess of food—showing how
food in excess chokes and blocks the system throughout—impeding
its proper functions, and rendering the
perfect manifestation of life impossible. During the
healthy growth of the body, the great process of upbuilding
and the functions of nutrition are necessarily
somewhat in excess of the processes of destruction;
but even here a great excess of food is invariably eaten;
and, while the growing child may be adding (say)
half-an-ounce a day to its weight, it is urged and even
forced to eat a pound of food a day, and even more!
And the natural result is that the child becomes sick,
and has colds and fever and other troubles, and no one
can account for it! The same false notions are carried
into adult life. Nearly everyone eats far too much—I
mean by this very much too much. I believe that
most persons could reduce their three daily meals to
one, and curtail the amount eaten at that one meal,
and still be ingesting too much food for the bodily needs.
This will at all events show us how enormously we do
overeat, and the only reason that we do not get ill
immediately is, that the body is constantly getting rid
of the excess of food material and poisons that are
formed, as the result of this constant over-ingestion
of food. It is generally believed that, as long as an
individual is in health, or apparently so, he is not
injured by habitually eating more than is really necessary
for the healthy nourishment of his body, but this
opinion is utterly and dangerously false. It is, indeed,
one of the most mischievous errors entertained by the
human mind. For there is nothing in nature more
true, more certain, than these propositions: that all
vital action is necessarily attended with some expenditure
of vital power, and draws something from the ultimate
fund of life; and therefore all excessive vital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>267</span>
action, all intensity of vital action, increases the expenditure
of vital power, and necessarily abbreviates
the duration of human life; and consequently, however
long the vital economy of any human body may be able
to preserve the general balance of action, between the
composing and decomposing elements, and maintain a
general health of the system under excessive alimentation,
yet nothing is more certain than that, just in
proportion as the alimentation has exceeded the real
healthy wants of the vital economy, and thus caused an
unnecessary expenditure of vital power, life has been
abbreviated—even though the individual die from
what is called old age, without a single violent symptom
of disease. The error of opinion on this subject is
common and mischievous; and the truth should be
presented in its strongest light.</p>

<p>But we have as yet only presented the subject and
contemplated it in its most favourable aspect. The
case I have presented is a very extraordinary one. As
a matter of fact, very few indeed who have constantly
over-nourished their bodies <i>do</i> die from old age, but as
a rule they die from painful and exhausting diseases
long before that period is reached. Millions of human
beings perish by disease, in all periods of life, from
excessive alimentation or overeating. Generally, they
are cut off by disease long before they have lived out
their lives, and often prematurely. And the chief
cause of all such death is, I must insist, overeating.
This can readily be proved; and I have endeavoured
to show why it should be the case in my previous work.
Overeating is the chief cause of all diseases; and
disease shortens and destroys life. Of that there can
be no question. But even if no adventitious cause
comes in to induce sudden and violent death, either
local or general, the continued overworking of the
system will almost inevitably exhaust, debilitate and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>268</span>
relax some particular organ, and so destroy the balance
of action in the vital economy, and thus gradually lead
to chronic disease. Adipose tissue is deposited in
various parts of the body—causing ruptures of the heart
and the blood-vessels, and hence premature death.</p>

<p>It is therefore true, beyond all question, that in all
countries where human aliment is abundant and easily
procured, gluttony or excessive alimentation is decidedly
the greatest source of disease and suffering and premature
death known to man. “Excess in drinking,”
said Hippocrates, more than two thousand years ago,
“is almost as bad as excess in eating!” And the
statement has remained true from that day to the
present.</p>

<p>How much food should be eaten, then, in order to
remain in the best of health, and to preserve that
“just balance we term health”? I have no hesitation
whatever in laying down one general rule, which
it is always safe to follow. Every individual should
restrict himself to the <i>smallest</i> quantity that he finds,
from careful investigation and experiment, will meet
the wants of his system—knowing that whatever is
more than this is harmful.</p>

<p>Physiologists have got into a vicious circle when
discussing the question of the amount of food that the
system really requires. They have measured the
income and the outgo of the food values and co-efficients,
and have calculated the supposedly necessary quantities
of food that the body needs from these figures—a
practice open to many objections, and proved erroneous,
in certain directions already—as <i>e.g.</i>, by the Chittenden
experiments on low proteid intake. It never seems to
have struck these men that the more food that is ingested
into the system, the more must necessarily be
eliminated—for otherwise the body would choke up and
die. The fact that more N. is excreted because more is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>269</span>
ingested does not prove that the body has utilised all
this N., because it needs it, but shows merely that it
was enabled to convert it, by the expenditure of a great
amount of nervous energy, in the processes of digestion.
The experiment of mankind should be, <i>not</i> to see how
much food they can eat and live, but how little they can
eat, and yet live: for the <i>minimum</i> quantity of food
is doubtless the best for the system, and that indicated
by nature. But many physiologists do not see the
matter in this light. For them the amount of waste
determines everything!<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But,” as Dr Nichols pointed out, “what determines
the amount of waste? A man must get rid of
all he eats and drinks, or he must retain it in his
system. If he keep at the same average weight, the
daily waste will depend upon the daily consumption.
He who eats and drinks two pounds will lose two
pounds; he who eats and drinks six or eight pounds
must get rid of that quantity. How, then, are we to
get at the normal waste, and therefore at the requisite
quantity of food?”</p></div>

<p>Dr Nichols says further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is my experience—and I believe of many others
who work as I do—that the less I eat the better I feel.
I do not vary much in weight through months and years
from 160 pounds. In solid, dry weight, my food, day
by day, would not exceed ten or twelve ounces, and
often, for days together, it would not exceed six ounces.
I am satisfied by my experience and what I have seen
of the effects of diet upon others, that most persons
can be perfectly well nourished in full health and
activity on from four to eight ounces of food, excluding
liquids, and that the amount of water may safely be
left to the demands of thirst.”</p></div>

<p>This is even a more conservative estimate than mine
and Dr Rabagliati’s—since we both agree that twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>270</span>
ounces is the amount that is needed by the average
man, for an average day’s work. But then our calculated
allowance was not strictly “dry” diet; and the
difference may not be so great after all, when this is
allowed for.</p>

<p>The quantity of food eaten has so little relation to
strength and weight that we see men eating ravenously
and at the same time wasting to skeletons, and growing
weaker and weaker; and we have strong men living on
a spare and simple diet and increasing in weight. Indeed,
we see many patients increase in health and
strength during a <i>fast</i> of many days, when no food at
all is eaten! The truth is, that the amount of food
said to be eaten by navvies and other strong men is
not the cause of their strength, but it is their strength
which enables them to digest and dispose of such
quantities of food. Weak men would break down
under the strain. And indeed both weak and strong
men do, when the resistance of the body is lowered
by disease.</p>

<p>To economise life, which is the great secret of health,
we must find just the quantity of food we require—that
which will supply (indirectly) the force we need, and will
not uselessly take from what we have. Of course, we
must keep within the limits of our digestive power;
but we must do better than that. A man may be able
to digest and dispose of three times as much food as he
really requires. One ounce more than he requires is a
waste of force, a waste of life. We waste life in eating
more food than we need, in digesting it, and then in
getting rid of it. Here is a triple waste. “We have
other work to do in this world than eating unnecessary
food, and spending our strength for nought.”</p>

<p>In an excellent little book entitled “The Stomach
and its Difficulties,” by Sir James Eyre, M.D., there
is to be found some very good advice on this question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>271</span>
of diet, and particularly the quantity of food that man
requires. Speaking of this, Sir James says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Hunter, it is recorded, fed an eagle entirely
on vegetable, and a sheep on animal food; and yet life
and apparent health were sustained. Rabbits, if kept
fasting a long time, will eat meat greedily. The teeth,
however, were no doubt intended by our Creator to be
our main guide on this point.... Eating in excess is
the vice of the present day, and so well managed is it
that even religious persons will not see its sinfulness—<i>sinful</i>,
as absorbing and wasting so much more life and
food than the body requires, and which so many absolutely
need. Is drunkenness a sin and gluttony
not?... Gout, rheumatism and various other disorders
are often produced by the injudicious supplies given to
the stomach, both in quantity and quality.... We
too often charge cold and wet with being the cause of
attacks of disease, but these attacks would not have
occurred unless the blood had been infected with
particles of depraved matter resulting from over-indulgence,
or other irregularity of the organs of digestion—first
and foremost, from our injudicious supplies
to the stomach.... Perhaps we might lay it down as
a rule that the majority of men eat twice as much as is
really required for the support of health and strength....
No doubt as life advances we really require less food....
According to our mental and bodily employment, so
should we eat.... Nature herself often gives notice
of over-indulgence, by destroying appetite. Children
take the warning and refuse food altogether; but it
is so common a notion that we cannot go on without
regular meals, that many adults aggravate stomach and
liver derangements by persisting in taking food of some
sort, but which affords no nourishment at all, because it
cannot be digested, and thus acts as any other extraneous
substance, by increasing the already deranged
powers of the organ. We may rest assured that mischief
rarely happens in disease from want of food,
although much mischief is often caused by the ignorant
in pressing it, against the warnings of nature in depriv<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>272</span>ing
us of any desire for it. In the incipient stage of
many diseases, abstinence at first, and then a very
strict attention to judicious nourishment, will alone
cure them.”</p></div>

<p>After such a simple and clear statement of facts, it
seems to me little remains to be said. I cannot emphasise
too strongly the importance of limiting the
amount of the food supply; and particularly is this
warning applicable to vegetarians who are apt to
overeat, under the erroneous impression that they must
eat more, in order to offset the greater nutritive value
of the meat (supposedly)! The fact of the matter is
that they should eat <i>less</i>; and the more nourishing and
concentrated the food is, the less of it should they eat.
Most of the vegetarian dishes are highly concentrated,
and exceedingly rich in nutritive values. For that
reason they should be eaten sparingly. Nuts are
especially rich, and contain a large amount of proteid
in a small compass. In his pamphlet “Nuts and their
Uses as Food” (Yearbook, U.S. Dept, of Agr.), Professor
Jaffa says of such foods:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The digestibility of protein in 28 experiments with
mixed diets, to which were added fruits and nuts,
averaged 90 per cent. [see pp. 86-88].... The digestibility
of the carbohydrates in nuts, so far as the available
<i>data</i> show, is about equal to that of the same
ingredients in other foods.... It would appear that,
while it is not possible to state the exact digestion co-efficients
for all nuts, enough has been done to indicate
their high nutritive value and digestibility.... The
distress sometimes experienced when nuts are eaten is
undoubtedly often due to improper mastication or to
over-indulgence. The investigations made at the California
station indicate clearly that considerable quantities
of nuts properly eaten do not cause distress....
A fruit and nut diet may be arranged to furnish sufficient
protein, mainly from nuts, to satisfy the require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>273</span>ments
of the body.... When considering nuts, it is
readily observed that 10 cents will buy about the same
amount of nut protein as of animal protein, except in the
case of cheese and skim milk (which furnishes less).
If spent for peanuts, it will purchase more than twice the
protein and six times the energy that could be bought
for the same expenditure for porterhouse steak....
It is of more than passing interest to note that 10 cents’
worth of peanuts will contain about 4 ounces of protein
and 2767 calories of energy, which is more protein and
energy than is furnished by many rations regarded as
adequate for a day.... As a whole, nuts may be
classed among the <i>staple foods</i>, and not simply as food
accessories.”</p></div>

<p>I desire only to show in this place that nuts are a very
concentrated article of diet, and should be eaten sparingly.
The idea that more food should be eaten, when
going on to a vegetarian diet, is grossly erroneous, and
is the reason why many vegetarians fail. Less, not
more, food, should be eaten; and as soon as the stomach
has shrunk to its right proportions, and the customary
reaction from the stimulation of the meat has worn off,
a general feeling of invigoration and well-being will be
experienced—and retained, if the diet be properly
managed thenceforth. Too great care cannot be taken
not to overeat; everyone would be better for a few
days’ fast—particularly if they have been in the habit
of eating meat!</p>

<small>GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</small></h2></div>


<p>I think I have shown, in the preceding pages, that fruits
and nuts are man’s best, natural, and original food—the
food best suited to his organism—capable of
sustaining it in the highest state of health. If I have
merely induced a number of persons to experiment upon
themselves I shall at all events feel that this book has
performed its mission, as there can be no question that
wherever the fruitarian diet is tried, it is adopted and
finds its adherents. I have frequently known persons
go back to a mixed diet, after having tried vegetarianism
for a time, but I have never known of <i>one</i>, who after once
having tried the fruitarian diet, gave it up permanently.
Of course everyone may relapse once in a while;
and go on to another diet for a few days, but invariably
the fruitarian diet is again resumed at the end of that
time, with added appreciation of its worth. The fruitarian
diet is as far superior to the ordinary vegetarian
diet as that diet is superior to the “mixed diet”—including
meat. There is no comparison between the
two. Far more energy is experienced, while living upon
fruits and nuts; the necessity for so much sleep is
done away with—persons living upon this diet manage
very nicely on about six hours of sleep, generally speaking;
a feeling of cleanness and lightness is experienced
throughout the body; and in many other ways the
effects of the diet are noticeable. The fact that man is
intended by Nature to live upon such a diet is very
clearly indicated by his structure; and it is safe to say
that the nearer we live to Nature, the healthier and the
happier we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>275</span></p>

<p>I shall conclude with a few practical health hints, in
relation to diet, which I have omitted to mention in the
preceding pages.</p>

<p>Let us consider first of all mastication.</p>

<p>The importance of thorough <i>mastication</i> is now becoming
generally recognised. The experiments and
researches of Horace Fletcher, Professor Chittenden,
etc., have done much towards calling the attention of
the public to the importance of this subject, and its
great advantages—not only in ensuring health, but in
rendering the life longer and happier—are now generally
recognised. This subject has been so ably handled by
the two authors whose books I have mentioned, however,
that it would be unnecessary for me to go into this
question in greater detail here. To anyone who has not
made a study of this subject, I can but recommend
Fletcher’s “New Glutton or Epicure” and “The A.B-Z.
of our Nutrition”; also Professor Chittenden’s “Physiological
Economy in Nutrition,” and “The Nutrition of
Man.” Now for a few practical hints.</p>

<p>Never eat when mentally excited or very tired. It is
best to lie down a few minutes before each meal, if
possible, and take a short rest after it. Never take
exercise soon after a meal, or take a bath, or a swim.
All these have a tendency to draw the blood away from
the stomach—to the surface, or the parts exercised.
This is to be avoided, if possible. It is best to make the
meals somewhat regular, but never eat if you are not
hungry—go without any solid food until the next meal.
Drink water plentifully, meanwhile. In this way, an
appetite will be gained, and sickness prevented.</p>

<p>Take a few deep-breathing exercises each day. In
this way the requisite oxygen is supplied, and the food
ingested is utilised, instead of remaining more or less
mal-assimilated and unused by the system. Do not
take very hot or very cold foods or drinks. The best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>276</span>
temperature is that of the surrounding atmosphere, in a
comfortably warm room. Great care should be taken
of the teeth, as, when these are once gone, no false teeth
can ever take their place, and the standard of health is
almost invariably lowered, on account of the fact that
insufficient mastication is practised.</p>

<p>Finally—and this is a factor of great importance—the
<i>mental condition</i> should be one free from worry or care.
I have been contending very strongly throughout this
book for the superiority of certain foods over others;
and the value of a hygienic diet; and I still think that
this question is one of the most important before the
world to-day—alike for the individual and the race.
Nevertheless, I am persuaded that much, if not all, of the
value of a reformed diet may be offset by constant fretting
and worrying about the food eaten. I believe that it
would be better to eat a moderate amount of any food
upon the market and think nothing about it, than to
eat the best of foods—the most wholesome and the
most nutritious—and keep worrying about them all the
time. The hygienist should supply his body with good
food, and then forget it. He should not think or worry
about his food or himself in the least. Some individuals
spend almost the whole of their lives in thinking about
their food; and the consequence is that they constantly
have dyspepsia, and get no benefit from any of it. One
can dwell upon this food question far too much—to the
point of becoming morbid about it. I went through
that transition stage myself—one which I am glad to say
I have experienced, because it enables me to appreciate
the mental condition of others in a like state. I am
also glad I have passed through that stage, and have
emerged into what I consider a more sane and normal
view of these matters. At one time in my life, the foods
I ate formed a large part of my mental occupation and
interest: I thought between meals what I should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>277</span>
for the next. I balanced up my every article of diet,
and even went so far as to discriminate between the
various kinds of nuts, because of the different percentages
of proteid they contained! In those days I
should as soon have thought of killing my dearest friend
as eating a piece of meat!—so monstrous did the idea
seem to me. I sided with all those individuals who
stated with glee that “they had not touched a piece of
meat for twenty-two years”—and so on. When I
went out to dinner, I informed my hostess that I was
a vegetarian, and asked to be excused from being helped
to meat. But now I have emerged from that state of
narrowness. Now, while I live upon the fruitarian diet,
and that pretty strictly, when alone, I do not think I
am being poisoned if I taste a piece of meat, when
dining out, knowing that my system can well take care
of the poisons generated, so long as I live all the rest
of the time upon a normal diet; and I do not at all
worry about my food, but eat a little of most of the
things that are upon the table, and make up for it
by slightly added care in my diet during the next
day or two. Thus, though I consider the diet question
one of the most important—if not <i>the</i> most important—before
the civilised world to-day, I must warn all diet
reformers against this tendency to get into a rut, on
account of their food habits, and would advise them to
be careful to preserve a sane balance of mind on these
questions, and a just proportion in their viewpoint.
Most diet reformers are too deadly in earnest. They
should cultivate a sense of humour!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX</h2>
</div>


<p>It is with pleasure that I present a photograph of my
friend Max Unger (“Lionel Strongfort”), doubtless the
strongest man in the world to-day, and one of the most
beautifully and perfectly proportioned. He is a strict
vegetarian—at times a fruitarian—and a strong advocate
of this diet. His statue in marble is in the National
Art Gallery at Berlin. It was made at the request of
the German Government, by Prof. Louis Tuaillon, of
Rome. The famous artist, Max Klinger, also considers
him the ideal of symmetrical athletic beauty, and found
in him the inspiration of several of his masterpieces.</p>

<p>Mr Unger has doubtless performed feats of strength
never equalled in the history of the world. With one
hand he has lifted a bar-bell above his head weighing
312 pounds. Even the far-famed Eugene Sandow
never lifted more than 250 pounds in this way. He is
the only man who has ever torn five packs of playing
cards in halves, at one time—a thickness of 260 cards.
He has lifted a weight (using his entire body) of more
than 8000 pounds—a sixty horse-power automobile,
containing several men, together with a heavy bridge,
over which the machine passed. In view of this, how
absurd the contention that strong men “must eat meat”;
that “they are strong because of the meat they eat,”
etc.! And how doubly absurd the contention that the
average man, who takes but little exercise, cannot perform
his daily duties without the use of this article of
diet!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> At first sight this position seems, of course, absurd, and opposed to the
well-known facts of calorimetry: but such is not the case. All the known
facts as to the equivalence of energy, heat, work, etc., can be accounted
for just as readily on my theory of the relations of food and bodily
energy—viz. that the energy is restored by sleep (the nervous system,
like an electric motor) and not by combustion, as in the steam engine.
As to the equivalence noted, this can be accounted for by assuming that
as energy acts upon matter, it wastes; and this waste is made good by a
proportionate amount of food. There is therefore an equivalence, a relation,
but it is not that of cause and effect. For the details of this theory,
however, see “Vitality, Fasting and Nutrition,” pp. 225-303 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> I would point out, in this connection, however, that, apart from
this possible shortening of the small intestine, <i>no anatomical changes
whatever</i> have resulted from a partially carnivorous diet for the
hundreds of years that have preceded us, and upon which man still
largely subsists. Doubtless this is partly due to the fact that much
<i>other</i> food was always eaten with the meat consumed; and also the
fact that the poorer classes—the peasantry, etc.—were unable to
purchase large quantities of meat at any time—and hence to eat it.
With them it was always an occasional luxury, rather than a steady
article of diet. The interesting fact is, however, that, in spite of these
hundreds of years of abuse, the human alimentary tract still maintains
all the characteristics of the frugivorous animal, and in no way
resembles the carnivorous alimentary tract! Had our hundreds
of years of flesh-eating enabled us to subsist upon such a diet with
impunity—or even adapted the human body to the diet in any
degree—as is frequently contended—then our alimentary tract
would indicate that fact by its evolutionary modifications. As this
is not the case, however, what becomes of the argument that
meat is a necessary article of diet, because man has subsisted largely
upon it for hundreds of years?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Dr Woods Hutchison and other writers upon the subject have
contended that all flesh-eating animals have their eyes set in the
front of their heads, and all herbivora on the side. Because man’s
eyes are set in the front of his head, it is contended, therefore he is
carnivorous! This argument is completely disproved by the fact
(among others) that the higher apes, which, in a state of nature, are
pure frugivora, have their eyes set in the front of their heads—as
has man. This is consequently no argument whatever in favour of a
flesh diet.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> This is most interesting. It shows conclusively that at one time

through countless ages, as the result of deprivation and lack of
their proper and natural food.</p>

are living almost wholly or largely on such a diet. When it comes
to a discussion of the relative merits of the two diets ... we need

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> It is important to note, in this connection, that but a small
percentage of the starch is ever converted into sugar, even by the
most thorough mastication. I say this on the authority of Dr John
Goodfellow, F.R.C.S., author of “The Dietetic Value of Bread,” etc.,
who conducted a number of careful experiments on this very point.
(See his letter to Dr Densmore, in “How Nature Cures,” pp. 237-239.)
In raw cereals, only about one per cent. was converted! As this
process of conversion cannot go forward in an acid medium—<i>i.e.</i> in
the stomach—it is evident that the bowels must be called upon to
effect this conversion—a useless tax upon them, and a cause of
constipation as well.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> It is an error—though a common one—to suppose that the fruitarian
diet causes a loss of weight. My own weight has remained
about the same for ten years, no matter what I eat, or how much.
On this diet the weight will go <i>to normal</i>—and, generally speaking,
it is necessary that some weight should be lost, in order to effect
this.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
